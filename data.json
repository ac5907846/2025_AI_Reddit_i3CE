I am now a business owner and I’m working to open a bakery in small town Ohio. I am leasing my space and my landlord is in the other portion of the building. \n\nI applied for plunbung, occupancy, change of use and building permits. I sent in plans and I was good to go. Everything was approved.\n\nInspector comes out and fails me because he claims we did work without permits. I did not do work outside the permits and the building owner said the stuff was there. \n\nI was told I needed to pull a gas permit, hvac permit and electric permit. And a sign permit, but that was a misunderstanding on my side so I’m pulling that one. The gas line was covered under a permit in 2022 so I don’t have to pull that. \n\nHowever, they’re saying we need to now pull permits for anyone work completed by previous owners. And I quote “sounds like other people did work without permits and now it’s caught up and you’re the one holding the stick” \n\nIs this right? Am I supposed to pull permits for work we never completed? How can they hold my occupancy because of this? Do I have any options? ",

They also know your time is your money. It might be easier in the long run to bit the bullet and do what the previous occupier should have. Good luck with your business.",
      "  That’s definitely the logical thing to do, but the pride in me is struggling to let them win when they’re in the wrong. I’m filing an ethics complaint with the state on the inspector, but what else can I do? They’re the powers that be. What powers are over them?",
      "    Yeah, that's the problem there isn't anyone above them that normally gives a shit. Hopefully the permits you need are simple issue and sign for work done without. We had a previous tenant install a power panel without enough clearance and it turned into thousands to move it and figure out how to make it work up to code.",
      "      The permits they want me to pull are another 1500 after I already paid 600 for permits. I called the building department and she said I didn’t need anything from\nThe start. Then occupancy and change of use came out. So I did that. Now it’s all these new ones. The kicker is they have no clue. They told me to pull a gas permit but that was permitted back in 2022, but since its clean pipe the inspector was convinced it was a new line.",

I'm to the point where most (but not all) of the wall girt and roof purlin framing is done.  I am going to sheath the exterior walls in 7/16 OSB in leu of diagonal X-bracing, and I'm almost ready to sheath it.  The roof steel is not on yet, and I figured some lateral bracing from the OSB would be a good idea before putting all that extra weight (and myself) on the roof.  My question is this... if I won't have a roof on it for several weeks after the wall sheathing/housewrap is installed, do I need to worry about moisture intrusion on the exposed inside face of the OSB?  If I'm using housewrap anyway, would it be a good idea to install the OSB backwards, with the moisture resistant face inwards to the exposed interior of the building and then housewrapping what is usually the inside face of the OSB but on the exterior of the building?  Should I do 2 layers of housewrap (one on the inside of the OSB and one on the outside)?  Any suggestions for protecting the OSB on the exposed interior of the building would be appreciated!",

      "You could paint one side of the OSB might help short term.  Im sure double house wrap would be alright if it’s breathable, but I’m not too fond of the idea of encapsulating the OSB, might be a worse scenario for any water that does make its way in.  Also I live in the Midwest where pole barns are a dime a dozen, and I’ve never seen one with wall sheathing under the metal. The Ribbed metal actually has a shear strength similar to that of sheathing, and a diagonal brace in each corner is a pretty simple task. Sheathing under the roof metal is pretty common though, solves the roof condensation issues."

For example I hate painting and I hate Insolation so I avoid doing those types of jobs. Actually to sum it up I hate “finishing” I enjoy framing.

    "Content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how we could manage our job sites and operations easily, and I’ve recently received a few emails from companies offering custom software where all the data would stay on **our own system** and within **our company brand**. This made me wonder:\n\n* Can mobile apps really help us track when jobs are completed, where the crew is, and how long they worked? Does tracking these things help make payroll and task accuracy better, and does it actually save us time and reduce project or job costs?\n* Are these tools good for keeping track of job histories, progress, schedules, and on-site documents? Is it easier to make decisions when everything is in one place, rather than finding data on papers or spreadsheets?\n*  Does having all this information—like where the crew is, what tasks are being running or done,  and how long they take.. manage schedules & resources—help with smarter decisions about **budgets and costs**? Is this approach better than traditional methods?\n*  I’ve noticed that some software like **Procore (https://www.procore.com/)** store all our business data on their system. Is it actually safe to trust them with our business data? **I’ve heard they can access it anytime since it’s on their system. How secure is that, and should we be worried about where the data goes? They can even look on our business data, budgets, payrolls, project data anytime!**\n\n>Some software companies have emailed me about custom software where all the data stays on **our system** and is only accessed by **our company**. **They said they will host the software system on our own cloud server and provide support and maintenance.** Is this more valuable? Would having our own software system, mobile app built for our specific needs bring more benefits in terms of process, needs, business documents , data and long-term value?\n\nI’m really trying to figure out if it’s necessary to go digital for smooth management, or if we can stick to our traditional methods.\n\n  \nFor those who've switched to software or mobile apps systems for sites management, has it made a big difference in your workflow or costs?\n\nThanks for any advice! 😊",

Inverse for the warm months. \n\nI'm the type of dude that shovels snow in a t-shirt and shorts. I need something to protect me from the cold, but not so much that I'm sweating bullets 5 minutes into the day.",

Fingers frozen to the bone trying to notch out a tile for a backsplash or something. \n\nThe point stands though, I'm not like a road worker or whatever. Work keeps me warm. I just need something to bridge the gap.",
      "    I just wear layers under armor long sleeve, teeshirt topped with a carhartt sweatshirt in New England",
      "I have the Yukon flex jacket from DriDuck. I like it a lot more than Carhartt gear I had before- super comfortable, durable, and the material is softer than usual duck canvas. It’s a slimmer cut not boxy like Carhartt, I’m 6’1” 170lb and the medium fits great even with a couple lighter layers underneath",
      "I second the idea of a vest. They are super great to work in and provide a lot of warmth. \n\nIf you don’t need a jacket for very rugged work, I’d also recommend any type of soft shell jacket. I have an l.l. Bean “Stormfleece” hooded jacket. It’s light, soft and flexible. It isn’t as rugged as canvas but it’s more water resistant and a lot more of an athletic feel while im working."

      "A couple ways I’ve used; cost plus, materials and labor plus a percentage like 15-30% (you have to turn a dollar into more dollars), more difficult is pricing by the job which you need an understanding of the market value of the service and material you sell and making a well detailed estimate with strict line item descriptions to avoid “free” change orders as customers unfortunately change their mind about expectations.  This takes more work but I find it more profitable.  You can get estimates from contractors to figure out these prices, or go on forums like this and people are usually generous with info.  Hope this helps.",

      "You want any exterior fixture ( window or door ) to mount in such a way that the frame of it covers the gaps that exist in the layers of the homes exterior. Ie: say you have a brick façade and rigid styrofoam insulation, then plywood, then studs. So place the window frame so these gaps are not open to weather or you will regret it quickly.  Re-install this window, once its done following the above guidelines? Mount drywall, THEN is the time to take a measurement from windows frame to painted surface of drywall, say 13/4”? So set table saw @13/4” and rip the needed extension pcs for all 4 sides viola done ready for trim",
      "If the window works without binding, Rip wood jamb extension at 1/2”.",
      "What you are concerned about is actually not a real problem. \n\nIt is one more step of getting some casing and ripping it down to whatever thickness of drywall you are putting on, then trimming it out to that depth. \n\nThe real problem here is that you have zero room for movement and/or thermal expansion.\n\nYou should pull that window out and remove that inner set of 2 x 4s. Replace with a double thickness of ½\" plywood and leave yourself about ½\" gap between the window and the surrounding wood opening.\n\nThen use two cedar shims against each other to create a flat but adjustable surface. Place that two pack of shims at the bottom, 4\" in from the sides, on both sides. Then again at the top and both sides. Tighten the shims equally to create a snug fit and then screw through the cedar shims to fasten the window into the frame. \n\nCut off the shims sticking out, spray foam the gap, refinish your weather sealing and finish interior. \n\nIf you don't fix the lack of gap sooner or later (as in this spring or winter) the window will start binding in the frame as the wall settles.\n\nYour caulking looks fine. If it is behind a finish it doesn't have to look good, it needs to do a job.",
      "  This dude caulks and glazez.\n\nOP listen to this stud.\n\nI would like to add, you should consider dealing with the window header framing as well. Those pieces of wood flat ontop are just in for the ride. Should be, at the minimum, two 2x8 on edge beam. And then supported by some studs of wood.",
      "    Double 2x6 is fine for that window, also, if it's in a gable end wall, not really much load coming down on it.",

      "Just sheetrock straight over the window",

      "Is this window mounted by a flange?  If so and it’s right against the sheathing then you did it right. Windows are mounted and sealed on the exterior. Call the top and sides leaving the bottom without caulk for weeping purposes. If it’s short of the drywall make an extension jam and window sill. To cover any gaps before you install trim.",

So far, there is no indication of potential serious issues that could arise during construction or affect the future sale of the property.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of the site’s history:\n\n- Brickworks with clay pits from 1889 to 1926\n- No records from 1926 to 1956\n- Used as a household waste landfill in the 1950s\n- Landfill waste remained uncovered for 25 years\n- Purchased approximately 40 years ago and covered with rubble, gravel, and Type 1 material\n- Operated as a builder’s yard for the last 40 years\n\nI would appreciate any thoughts or advice on potential issues that might arise from the site’s former use as a landfill. If anyone has experience with similar projects or has encountered related challenges, your insights would be extremely helpful.\n\nMany thanks in advance! 🙂",

The most important thing is to start investing early, and I wish I had. I'm nearly 40 and it took me a long time to learn how to live within my means.",

      "    It’s not impossible. So many people waste so much money on things they don’t need. So many people can’t decide the difference between a want or a need. I ate ham and cheese sandwiches for lunch every day for 3 years so I could save and invest. I still do sometimes but my girlfriend cooks so now I take leftovers for lunch most of the time. I will agree though it is difficult for younger workers who haven’t grown their earring power to invest 15% and save 20% which is why at least in my post I said “as much as you can”",

Builders in the area are slow af - they're just trying to keep their guys working right now.  I know it varies based off location but it's not going too well around me.

When machines are threading paper or have a break the paper feeds into one of these tanks. The blender you see sticking out of the wall is an agitator and helps return the \"broke\" (paper that doesn't make it to the reel) to pulp, it is then pumped back into the system and run back through the machine. \n\nDepending on the size of the machine there will be multiple repulpers. Small machines may have two while larger ones may have four or five. They are generally placed at the end of drier sections so that the machine does not need to be threaded all in one shot. \n\nSorry for the info dump. There is more to it but that is the basics.",

Got back on the wagon after a couple weeks, because I “had no reason” to be sober, because I was sitting at home all day.\n\nI’m currently trying to wean, while taking gabapentin, and hydroxyzine for any anxiety that arises. I’ve taken naltrexone, but I personally can’t stand the way it makes me feel (drowsy and out of it; [if someone’s reading this that needs naltrexone, don’t not take it because of my experience, everyone’s body is different]).\n\nI do need to get into meetings, and I do need to see a therapist (I think everyone should see a therapist, regardless of substance abuse), but my lack of funds from my lack of work for a couple months, and job searching, has put that on the back burner a bit.",
      "      We spend so much time and energy looking for an easier, gentler way to get sober. AA is that way. You don’t have to do it alone, and if you’re an alcoholic like me then following the program of AA as outlined in the big book WILL make your life better. \n\n>If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we are half way through. We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it. We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace. No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.\n\n>Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among us-sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.",

      "                      So for starters, no ya don't: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption_per_capita\n\nSince you're struggling with the math the average Canadian drink 8.1-9.9l per YEAR. The UK drinks 9.8-10.8. You guys are even behind the USA. \n\nSo 12 beers a day at 5% etoh (labatt blue) works out to 12 beers a day x 12 fluid oz x 7 days a week x 52 weeks a year is 52416 fluid oz. 52416 x .05 (etoh content) =  2620.6 fluid oz of pure alchole. 2620/33.8= means you drink 77.528l of pure alchole a year. \n\nYou drink 7.832 times the average Canadian. \n\nTo put this into prospective, the 90th precent of Americans (who out drink Canadians) drink 73 drinks per week, you're drinking 84. So you're out drinking probably 95% of people with some guesswork. (Paying the tab study)\n\nSo you are an alcoholic. Alcohol use disorder is shown to take 24-28 years off your life. Life expectancy in Canada is 82.6 years so your looking at 56.6 if you take the average. This drop further if you get addmitted for an acute issue (47-53 years respectively)\n\nThat's MORTALITY, then there's MORBIDITY. AUD leads to: cirrhosis, fatty liver, hepatitis, cardiomyopathy (heart failure), hypertension, pancreatitis, cancer, megloblastic anemia via folate and b12, wernicke encephalopathy, mental health disorder and suicide/accidents. So even if you don't die, you won't be healthy. \n\nAt 37 your future is not written in stone. While acutely quitting may lead to withdraw or seizure the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. Medication (like gabapentin 1200x1 then 300 tid for 7-10 days) are great during this acute phase. \n\nI urge you to take this seriously, and don't take my word for it. You're connected to the internet and have that Canadian healthcare. Please speak to your doctor.",

I've never seen consuming that amount of alcohol on a weekly basis as being weird or medically obtrusive. \n\nSo I continued this behaviour when I moved to London. Surrounding myself with new English friends, a new partner etc, it quickly became apparent that THEY thought I had a drink problem. So I cut way down in consumption but struggled to sleep, struggled with stress, struggled in the relationship because I felt I had no \"me time\" to just deflate after a days work.\n\nThis relationship eventually ended. I ended up homeless. Lost all my friends. After 6ish months Ianaged to get rehoused. Found work again.

You start shaking from lack of booze and realizing you'd probably have a little something in life if you didn't spend it all on alcohol. \n\nThese days, I drink maybe once or twice a month, smoke medical on the weekends, and enjoy the savings, as well as the clear head at work.\n\nMy life really took off after I stopped living in a state of perpetual intoxication.",

      "          Natural fractions.  Same reason people will say that's about 1/4 or that's 1/2 or 1/3.  As people those are very useful measurements that are easy to keepnin out head.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase 10 can only divided by 1, 2, 5, 10.  1/10, 2/5, 1/2  Base 12 can be divided cleanly into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.   1/12, 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 So if you want to say put decorative fluting across 100mm of paneling it becomes much easier to divide that 100mm up with more different numbers of fluting.   Same goes with any measurement of any thing.  Say you have a large recipe but you only want to make 1/3 of it or you want to increase it by 3/4ths.  In dozenal base it's a natural fraction you can just do with carrying any numbers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why base 12 and base 16 counting is so common thoughout history.  Why we have the number eleven and 12.  Why there are 12 inches in a foot.  Ancient craftsman building houses and saddles 1and carriages could easily take fractions of of a 12 base measuring tool.  Also because you can use your fingers like an abacus in base 12 to count to 144",

      "1. Low carbon concrete CAN be used for structural elements. They typically have lower early strengths because a lot of time they use slag or similar instead of portland cement but eventually they hit the strengths required.\n2. At least in the US, we are seeing a major push by mega projects (data centers, manufacturing, etc.) to use low carbon concrete. They recognize that with their mega projects comes environmental concerns and are making efforts to get both low carbon concrete and other carbon reducing measures included (steel, etc.).\n3. There is no 'brand' of low carbon concrete. It is a type of mix design that your local ready mix supplier needs to be ready to make. MOST entities in the US are not ready for this but some of the larger ready mix suppliers (Smyrna, Cemex, etc.) are starting to get on board in some facet. There are additives you can get but they are not truly what you are looking for.\n\nIn order to see if this is even feasible for your project, you need to understand what your local ready mix suppliers can handle. Changing to low carbon concrete disrupts their entire supply chain (in a good way I think) but most just havent made the dive into it yet.",
      "  Thank you for such detailed comment. Much appreciated!\n\nMy client actually mentioned Smyrna and Cemex. I did not want to mention them in my original post, as to not cause a bias or so.\n\nSince you know of them, do you have experience with those companies/suppliers? Or what do people around you think of their low-carbon concrete?\n\nPersonally, I am leaning more towards one of them, but again, I don't want to bias your answer.",
      "    I have not used low carbon concrete with either but have purchased standard ready mix with them.\n\nI think both are headed towards figuring out supply chain concerns with low carbon concrete but it depends on how remote your location is. IE: if you are in a major market for them, you're more like to get support from them. If you are in a remote market, probably not.\n\nMy personal opinion is to get someone who has done low carbon concrete on other projects. Do not try to be the 'first project' for someone. Even if their company has done it, make sure that specific batch plant has done it.\n\nI have had issues (another smaller supplier in remote market) with trying to get a 'new' plant ready for low carbon concrete. Mix design testing takes months in some cases, the stuff coming out of the plant sometimes matched the mix design (and hit break strength) while others did not hit strength at all, and getting their supply chain figured out took time. Eventually they figured it out but not before stuff had to be ripped out.",

We do a lot of government work and there's a hard push to minimize the impact of federal projects, so that's where we're typically able to use those less impactful materials. \n\nIn private/commercial work it's a lot harder to show clients the value in sustainable/low-impact materials because they're far more resistant to the initial cost impact, rather than the lifecycle cost.\n\nTL;DR if it's government project it's encouraged (if it's non-military and public-facing), if it's private it's typically a no-go.",

This is 100% repairable and you have a few options depending on the situation.\n\nIf this spot has access to an attic or basement, you can simply just extend the wires by installing a junction box on each end of the original wires and running short pieces of new wire between the boxes to connect the original wires together. A single box does not give you enough wire to work with so that's why you need to extend the wires with 2 boxes.\n\nIf there is no access once the space will be finished, you can use an in-wall splice kit, like [this one for the 3 wire cable ](https://www.homedepot.com/p/NSi-Industries-Non-Metallic-Cable-Splice-12-14-AWG-For-3-Conductor-Cable-with-Ground-NMS-3/307358485) and [this one for the 2 wire cable](https://www.homedepot.com/p/NSi-Industries-Non-Metallic-Cable-Splice-and-Tap-Kit-12-14-AWG-For-2-Conductor-Cable-with-Ground-NMT-2/307358546). I generally treat these as a last resort type thing when there's no other option because, even though they are rated to be buried in a wall or ceiling, there's still the potential for the splice to fail and needing to open up the wall or ceiling to access it.\n\nIf this is in a wall or ceiling then you can make a small access panel for the splice if you're okay with having that.\n\nThe last option, and the most expensive, would be to have an electrician re-wire the affected circuits.

The guys who don't stretch end up fat old cripples \n\n\nTry seeing how long you can hang off a joist for. Then tomorrow stretch first and see how long you can do it. The guys who don't stretch go for like 35 seconds, tops ",

Then one night I went to a friend's bachelor party. Got shitty drunk and passed out on the floor. The next day my back hardly hurt at all. I was amazed. Turns out, it was my mattress. I got a new really hard one and the problem was gone for the most part. Try sleeping on the floor for 1 night. Just to see if it helps.",

I complained of chronic lower back pain for years in my mid to late teens and my family doctor just kept saying “do more core exercises”, which was ridiculous because I used to be a gymnast and could do the human flag my core was so solid. After years of fighting with her, she finally sent me to a specialist and turns out I had compression issues in some of my lower discs likely cause from a snowboarding accident I had when I was younger. 19 isn’t normal to not be able to tie your shoes buddy, get proper help and soon.

Some of those stretches are AMAZING.  Just hits the right spot and it hurts so good lol.  Yeah, you’ll feel like a dumbass in some poses, but it works man.\n\nETA: also coupon this with seeing a PCP and a chiropractor.  At your age you should be able to tough it out, but the cell phone hunch is giving younger generations more musculoskeletal issues from having our shoulder forward and head down.  You may be in the same position operating and you never get relief.    You don’t want to be that old guy with his head and neck hunched over so bad you could set a coffee cup on his neck.",

We are taught that pain is necessary for healing but in this case it is not true. \n\nThe book offers a bunch of suggestions for ways to sit, ways to lift things off the floor, ways to sleep for different kinds of back pain.

      "      I'm fairly certain drywall screws only come in phillips, though I suppose I could be wrong.\n\nThe key to keeping a bit in good condition is letting off the clutch as you feel the screw tighten.  Don't let the bit spin in the head of the screw.  You'll not only cam the screw out, but you can overtighten it, causing the hole to strip out, and it damages the bit.  \n\nOnce you get the timing right, it'll be second nature to you.  For most applications, it's better to have to tighten the screw up some more than overtighten it and have to loosen it up after or risk stripping the hole.",

Those are the hardest on tools. If you have a choice go with square recessed type screws. A good square bit of the PROPER SIZE will last. Some screws are actually combination square and Phillips.",

      "I’ve found that by using new screws and the EXACT right bit for each screw (there’s a difference between ph and pz for example, and between normal and impact bits), using proper technique by lining the drill correctly, bits last way longer. As soon as the bit starts to wear, get a new one. \n\nI have vivid memories of an experienced handyman rounding off bits and screws, shouting and swearing while our ragtag crew was renovating a large building. Frustrated, I went to a builders merchant who calmly explained why this was happening and what the bit names and numbers mean, and which ones we need to get. I get two weeks from a bit even with heavy use, but they are not indestructible and need replacing regularly",
      "  Yeah I get that basic concept but unfortunately I can't always do all that and it outs extra wear in them.

Just looking for a bit that can handle the abuse i have to put it through to get better and slightly longer performance.",

Short driver, maybe you can get an impact in? Get one of those flexible extenders, or a corner situation, not the 90dgree one but the one that goes on a socket wrench what ever they're called. Or Milwaukee bits, tend to last long atleast the torx ones :)",
      "          Yeah I get what your saying. Don't have a tarp. I'm not the only one using them so can't always control that. I try and close up the bags or use whatever clean ones i see. But recently they took all the boxes back and we had to use some of the thrown out bags that had gotten dirty. So making do with what we have. Focus is usually doing it pretty quickly. Bit definitely see what yiur saying. The issue usually lies up in the rafters where I dint have proper footing and rely on the drill and magnet to hold the screw and sort of free hand it.

I’ve had a couple of these bits riding around in my bit case for a decade or more that used occasionally. Despite the fact that they are designed to cam out when the screw is flush with the paper, they still work great. Just buy a hand full of them."

    "Title": "OSHA: using gas-powered saw for indoor steel (boiler) sawcut?",
    "Content": "We hired an established HVAC company to replace our 70-year-old boiler in our 6-unit condo building in Chicago.\n\nOn the first day, during removal, it was discovered that the boiler had been welded together, and they needed to figure out a way to get it out of our basement through a standard-frame door. They said they had a guy coming that would help cut it down.\n\nI only learned this because I checked in to learn what was happening—nothing was ever proactively communicated to us. Before I could check in again, the smoke and carbon monoxide detectors went off in our front hallway on the top (3rd) floor. Me and my husband were putting fans in all the windows to vent out the hallway, but we kept having to turn the alarms off. We tried going down to the basement to find out what was happening, but there was so much dust in the air, we couldn’t breath. They were cutting on and off for maybe 4.5-5 hours, late into the evening. By the end, all residents had headaches and one (who lived above the boiler) was contemplating going to stay in a hotel with her cat because she felt so nauseous. I, myself, had a headache the rest of the evening, even after opening all my windows after they had finished. The workers, themselves, only had black n-95 masks on during this. I'm not sure how they fared.\n\n \n\nTL;DR: It turns out, the company had hired a subcontractor to come in and cut the boiler down, and they used a gas-powered saw to perform the cutting indoors (in our basement in the back of the building).\n\nThey didn’t use any barriers during the cutting, so now there’s also a layer of dark steel dust over both sides of our basement, including all of our possessions (including expensive camping gear/other items) in our storage spaces. It’s a big mess, and they’ve tracked all that muck from the boiler and steel cutting all over our back patio and stairways. And to top it off, they were using our brooms and tools to clean up, so now those have a thick black lawyer of steel goop in them.\n\n\n\n**Question**: Is there an OSHA regulation or Chicago code regarding use (or restriction of use) of gas-powered sawcutting implements, or possibly of ventilation requirements? Should they at least offer to clean up after themselves?\n\n\n\nMe and my other tenants have been scared and very upset by the level of “workmanlike manner” (their T&C #2 in the contract) and professionalism during this project. We could barely afford a new boiler, and now we have to clean up after these guys, and buy new cleaning supplies, too? We're all very upset.\n\nThey may know how to fit a boiler, but they’re here trashing our home and are terrible communicators. The project is nearly done, and the only way we know what’s happening or if something’s going wrong is if we check in on them every hour or so. Between the headaches, stress, fielding resident complaints and concerns, etc., this project has also impacted me and my home business. I haven't been able to get much work done and this is a peak work period for what I do.",

      "The cast iron boiler was welded together? Someone who knew how to use silicon bronze rod actually welded that? I find it hard to believe.\n\n\nI'm going to just assume whoever hired this company went with a lower bidder. It's a multi section boiler, all you need to do is crack the sections apart once the jacket is off. If it was truly welded together there still wouldn't be a reason to use a gas cut off saw inside, and electric one would work fine.\n\n\nDid you hire this company OP, or did whoever owns the building?",
      "  Thanks for replying so quickly. Both I (Board Treasurer) and the Board President (also a condo owner in the building) hired them. We were told that there wasn’t any bolts, and the steel was too thick, which is why they went with the saw instead of a torch.",

      "      Never tried to cut cast iron with a torch have ya? It cuts like dogshit. “Better” than stainless which doesn’t mean much because stainless doesn’t cut at all, you have to melt it away which is how cast iron cuts just slightly quicker. The graphite in it doesn’t really oxidize and burn like it does in steel. \n\nNow, gas powered saw inside a basement is still dumb, and they’re making a mess like a bunch of toddlers, but a torch is an equally awful suggestion",
      "        Oh I know a torch doesn't work well on cast and I'm assuming it's a sectional cast iron boiler. Still doesn't warranty a gas powered saw for removal. You need a digging bar and a sledge hammer. He's saying they used a gas saw because the steel was too thick. Either they were cutting steel, he heard wrong, or no one in this situation has a clue.

We do framing, plumbing, flooring, drywall, siding, roofs, painting, etc. etc. The thing is, I want to get a general contractor's license that I can use in Missouri. I've only ever worked with him, and he's done this stuff for over 25 years. I can't seem to get a straight answer online about exactly what I need to get licensed.

You need a qualified contractor with a structural engineer.  With limited information I would say 50k to 250k. Probably closer to the higher end. I would consider some different design options to go over the existing elements to meet the style you are looking for. Could get the design you are looking for for a small fraction of the price",

THese are two separate pours so the top 4 inch would pop off very easily.  The 8 inches (top 3 rows of brick) are rebarred, and will need to be cut.  Under this 8 inches of rebarred concrete is the sand/screenings.\n\nWe built much of the house.  The columns are not load bearing, but we did use 2x4 to keep the trusses from sagging any when built.  These trusses are designed to extend over the porch.",

While I might’ve been nervous during construction if I was a neighbor, my concerns would’ve been pretty quickly relieved once I found out the total size of the place.

      "        I have Yeti coolers and love them, however, the thing is: They’re not worth the price tag if you’re using it for a couple hours-overnight and are opening the cooler frequently. Just get a regular, cheap cooler. \n\nThe best way to use Yeti’s is for prolonged cold storage. When I’m going out for like a week, I’ll load the Yeti with a block of dry ice, put down a layer of cardboard, then add bags of ice. Every couple days, I’ll pull a new bag of ice out of the Yeti and add it to my other cooler. \n\nIf you open the cooler frequently, the advantage of all that thick insulation doesn’t matter as much.",
      "          I disagree. Daily user of Rtic and Yeti. My yetis still work, my rtics are back up. There's no comparison to quality, longevity and cool time.",
      "            I agree. High-end coolers are going to keep ice better than inexpensive coolers. They’ll last longer and hold up to abuse better too. \n\nMy point is, a lot of people have high expectations and are then disappointed when ice doesn’t last longer than it does. That has a lot to do with how the cooler is used. If you open the cooler often, the ice isn’t going to last.\n\nBased on my experience, a cheap cooler is probably going to work fine for an afternoon or an overnight. The ice will melt faster, but you’ll be home or able to grab another bag of ice before that matters.\n\nI’d start looking at high end coolers if longer-term cold storage is needed and you use it intentionally that way.\n\nKnowing that might help someone decide between a $50 cooler and a $350 cooler.",

      "          I use for camping for food and generally use  2-3 days.  That said we do open and close a bit.  Will keep multiples of ice packs (get them from medical deliverables as better than normal ice) and food in it.  May add some dry ice based on your advice     It does keep stuff safe and cool even with open 3-4 times a day   drinks go in different cooler and that one gets opened and closed more often.  We will take 2 cool packs from the yeti each 12 hours or so as weekend goes to put in drink cooler.  Also freeze waters in drink cooler for initial cooling.  Wanting a better drink cooler that can hold better than the igloo I have right now \nWhere do you get dry ice and how big is it?",
      "          The two places I’ve been able to find dry ice locally are Fred Meyers and Baskin & Robins. I’m in the PNW. \n\nI don’t know what size the blocks of dry ice are, but I can fit two blocks fine in the Tundra Haul wheeled cooler.\n\nIf I’m off grid for long enough, though, it’s definitely a good system for keeping extra bags of ice.  \n\nI normally just use the freezer blocks that Yeti sells. They fit the interior of the cooler well and they freeze at a lower temperature. Those get me through several days. \n\nBut I mean, if you have the scratch, and want the best cooler for keeping drinks cold for the afternoon, something like the Tundra 35 is going to work very well.",

      "You need to be specially licensed for water restoration. You need to go to the DBPR website for direction.",
      "Wet drywall and carpet could develop mold, so that is a possibility as to why one would need a GC license. Insurance, bonding, and the like are necessary when you are dealing with abatement and matters of health.",
      "  Yup! Especially in a water logged part of the world like Florida.\n\nA homeowner could probably get away with doing it themselves on the house they're living in - but to go into business doing it is an entirely different story.\n\nThe upside of this is after you get the license you're now in a small pool of available drywall and carpet installers!",
      "I think you may be approaching this from the wrong angle. Water damage restoration is essentially the realm of insurance repairs and abatement as others have said. I personally would never even contemplate that work without a GC license or the knowledge/experience base to attain one.\n\nMost insurance companies have a very narrow set of contractors approved to do the abatement and demolition portion of an insurance repair like water damage. This is because there is tremendous liability involved and potential to demolish or otherwise abate materials outside of the approved scope of the claim. It is not a friendly place to begin learning. You would also for instance be expected to be testing, recording, and documenting your findings as part of the demolition and likely deploying moisture mitigation infrastructure like dehumidifier systems.\n\nHowever, if you want to put finish materials back after the approved abatement and demolition scope portion of the project is done, you could just be a regular carpet and tile sub. Xactimate will be important either way. There are entire subcontractors that cater to this kind of work who will be able to mesh with the insurance adjuster's vocabulary and means/methods of completing the insurance repair. \n\nIf you want to specifically do abatement (you mention tearing out wet carpet and drywall) and not, for instance, consult with a company to define abatement scope, yes, you should go learn under an established company and accrue the experience needed. As otjers have said it is critical you carry the necessary licensure, insurance, and bonding before taking on any scope of work.",
      "  I already did work for a restoration company, just not for 4 years, and not in Florida. It’s not difficult work and it doesn’t require much knowledge. They had me running around Pittsburgh doing my own jobs at 18. There’s no reason I can’t do it on my own now, except for legal red tape.",
      "    Happy for you. Sounds like you have all the info you need. If it is easy work and does not require much knowledge you should chart your own path to the necessary licensure and build that dream business bro.\n\nThe insurance companies are going to ask you as the owner very different questions than when you \"were running your own jobs\" at 18.",
      "      I didn’t say I was running my own crew, I was just going out on my own doing small water damage jobs, and sometimes supervising a crew of temp workers on bigger jobs.",
      "        Fair enough - and I should clarify, I'm not trying to come at you! Only highlight the complexities involved and demonstrate why the state of Florida may have deemed water damage mitigation to be something that requires a GC license. \n\nWe may also be talking about slightly different things. When you say restoration, I assume that is a restoration as the GC for the whole insurance claim. In my state, insurers typically will never allow the same contractor to do the remediation portion of the scope and the finish phase of the scope for liability reasons; though sometimes we are onsite to see damages before remediation begins. \n\nThe complexity in insurance work isn't so much complexity of the work itself (like for like replacement is pretty easy I agree) and more so navigating the insurance process such that your business can make money doing so. Just because insurance companies always pay for completion of their approved work doesn't mean you will necessarily be able to make money. There is often a lot of bargaining over Labor and material cost in my area because we have an unusual labor market and must be able provide evidence it is such.",

      "    I was wondering how does someone get 4 years documented field experience anyway. Do I have to keep a note book and write down every job site I step on. Or does it have to be signed off by an employer.",
      "      From my previous understanding an employer needed to sign off on your experience, but now I’m hearing that you can sign an affidavit saying you did the work. I’ll have to look into that.",
      "      You might consider doing this regardless for resume purposes. Even just a couple sentences about the project and your involvement/role/responsibilities with respect to the scope(s) of work onsite. I do not perform any work onsite with my hands myself (project management side of things) but have found a project list to be an invaluable component of an application for me both in job seeking and when I was applying for my master's degree. Your project list is distinct from your resume and can be longer than one page, it is a separate, supporting document; like a cover letter your employers really care about.\n\nIt was a fucking bitch to write up my project list the first time but maintening it becomes a habit just like writing a daily log. If you ever want your PMP it will also become relevant. The PMI definition of a project includes much more granularity than people assume.\n\nI typically write down cool Peep's contact info too. I have met some just absolutely rock solid guys as members of a project team who I didn't have an immediate and ongoing work relationship with at the time but went out of my way to develop one later based on what I saw of their character. I also love to give referrals for stuff if I think they're a good fit.",

So its like run your own business and qualify 1 other person/business or qualify 2 and no business, but basically you as a non license holder your looking for a gc thats just acting as a qualifier and he's gonna charge usually a percentage of what you make, some do a straight monthly charge. \n\nI know this from an electrician who basically retired from actually working to \"rent out his license\" and play with bitcoin.",

Hardie is probably more durable long term, its cement board after all, won’t burn, won’t rot, maybe it’s a little more annoying to work with. If my siding lasts 50 yrs, I’ll probably be too dead to care about it much lol. Whatever you choose is better than cheap vinyl.",

      "    Well there are a couple of things going on there. The first one is the air is far more humid. Depending on the attic ventilation and how quickly it can evap moisture, you could get a high moisture condition just in the atmosphere that's in the attic that's in the house that's everywhere. Really easy to grow mold on a home that's not ventilated that well by the way. You have all that humidity in the air, the sun hits the roofing shingles, warms up the attic, within a couple of days depending on how it's ventilated you can be growing mold. A lot of new homes are built with what's called a minimum ventilation value and half the time they don't even get that right. If everything is perfect there's not usually an issue with the 1/300 but if you have canister lights, ceiling penetrations, all that kind of stuff, I've seen countless homes growing fuzzies in the attic because of it. You live in a hot humid area so if you want to fix this get a hold of some drywall guys but I would poke your head up in the attic and make sure everything looks all right in about 1 or 2 weeks before you do it",

      "          Exactly, the amount of assumptions in here is mental. If the nut didn't tighten against the spin of the blade, then this would be a common occurrence.\n\nOnly reason this happened is because the plate was never on the saw to start with",
      "        That's what I was thinking. Used plenty of angle grinders and wet saws where if the arbor nut isn't tightened properly the blade just doesn't spin while everything else does. Man I'd love to see another view of this video of that blade actually breaking loose from the saw",
      "        If the motor or gearbox jams and stops instantly then the inertia of the wheel will unscrew the bolt/nut holding it on and run away. It tightens when there's torque driving the wheel. The wheel applied force in the loosening direction if the motor or gearbox jams suddenly.",

      "    It tightens against the rotation so how could it come loose?",
      "      The wallsaw i use (Tyrolit WSE 1632) has one central lockscrew which can turn free. You have to tighten it with 60NM with a Torque Wrench every time. You can switch the rotation of the blade at any time the blade is stopped. In fact, when concrete cutting you have to switch directions fairly often.\n\nHave you ever seen such a piece of equipment in use or are you just assuming it tightens itself? I think thats how the blade in the gif came loose......",
      "        Why would you need to change the direction of the blade on a track saw or you'd be running the blade backwards.",
      "          You dont want the blade to spin against the direction the machine is traveling. Only smaller blades have directions. And yes, in that case you dont change the direction of the spin. If the cutouts between the segments are straight, the blade has no direction and can be used in both directions.",
      "            I've worked with up to 60\" blades. All of them were directional.  They may not all have had an arrow on them, but all you need to do is look at the cutting edge. ",
      "              I was taught many moons ago if it wasn't obvious looking at the blade, to look for the tail on the diamond. A bit like the trail of a shooting star.",

It is advised to not stand in line of the blade when working, because of many things (spray, flying debris), but also just in case something decides to break.",
      "            This could've easily been a slab saw.",
      "        I never had my walls away come loose. Husqvarna electric saw. But I also only ever switched rotation direction if i was splitting bar. Rotation of the blade made no different regardless of direction the saw was traveling.\n\nThe nut on my floor saws would occasionally come loose however. When a saw throttles down or binds up there's plenty of opportunity for a nut to back off a bit if it has vibrated loose while cutting. I never had anything fall off the saw because it was pretty hard to miss. When that blade was even a tiny bit loose it didn't feel right. \n\nI could only see this happening to an inexperienced cutter who doesn't know the feel of the saw, probably didn't tighten the blade correctly, and who ran it too hard and keeps jamming the blade. \n\nJust my take tho, based on my experience with my particular equient! I'm not saying anyone else is wrong",

      "      Because walk behind saws vibrate a shit ton.",
      "        Yeah this is probably mostly the answer. It's just happens very rarely. And if it's vibrating when you throttle down it can work itself loose. It *should* always be tighter than that, but weird things happen. \n\nIn 15 years I never had the nut fall off, much less the flange or the BLADE because I laod attention and you can feel when something isn't right. But the nut would come loose on occasion. It wasn't for lack of tightening. I'm a big guy, and I would tighten as much as I could with the wrench by hand, then drop the blade on the ground and give that wrench a good stomp or two every time.",

Only drywall cracks we get is from truss uplift on roof trusses, and when they put a seam at a corner of two long / large spans.  You also are far less likely to see drywall seams when there is more time between coats for drying.",

Not the electrician I can promise you that.\n\nYour question and your comments come off condescending like I came to your work and asked “hey what do you guys do wrong all the time? Like over and over? But also that I have control over as a customer?”  You’d want to say “fuck you and fuck off” or something sarcastic.\n\nGood luck with your new project, approach the people building your house with just how much you don’t know in mind."

Usually 2-6\" thick and installed in a T frame similar to a regulars acoustic ceiling tile. Cost is a wide spectrum dependent on thickness, sound rating, finish, how high up. To many factors to just toss a number out, needs more info. But google Tectum Panel, lots of info out there."

      "Not normal in construction maybe normal in the wilderness when mining. I’m not an expert in stone but I am in water damage and this looks like it’s caused by moisture. Not sure if it will go away when dry but you could try putting air movement on it to see if it does. But also while typing and thinking usually interior stone will have some kind of sealant or clear coat if you will which would prevent moisture from moving through the stone like this.",

      "  Do not listen to this, that’s crazy talk. Maybe in Europe maybe a long time ago that was ok, but that’s not how things are done these days. \n\nImpregnating sealer (not lacquer) is a huge help, cheap, and easy to use. \n\nIt needs to be sealed before grouting but not necessarily before installing, and definitely not on the back! \n\nUse only white thin set mortar! The stuff that comes powdered and you mix with water into a paste like consistency. \n\nNever use mastic or pre mixed glue on lime stone or soft marble",

Whereas my Makita Impact feels more comfortable and better to control and has been going strong for a little over 3 years now.",
      "        I’ve been running the same Milwaukee M18 FUEL impact driver for over 6 years now.  The thing is an animal.  \n\nThe only issues I have had were the bit holder will sometimes fail to lock the bit in place and my bit will fall out.  Doesn’t happen much, but for sure I’ve had to crawl around looking for my bit. \n\nThe other one is that like 6 times I have gone to drive something and when I pull the trigger it’s dead.  Battery is fine, nothing helps.  I have to remove the battery and put it back in and it works just fine.  Weird but so rare as to not matter much and easily dealt with.\n\nOtherwise, it crushes Dewalt and Makita, we used to run tests and it wasn’t close.  I haven’t even had to replace any of my batteries in that same time frame.  And I live in Northern New England, leave my stuff in my truck over night, etc…\n\nI think Makita makes better carpentry specific tools, their cordless 12” compound bevel miter saw is the best in the business, etc…\n\nBut I have most of the Milwaukee stuff and it’s just fine, and their cordless finish guns are best in class.",
      "        It’s comfort for me as well. \n\nThe reliability is extremely high with all the top brands. Makita has anecdotally lasted me and my crews longer than any other brand but, more importantly, they fit my hands, etc.  better.",

Best woodworker I know uses clapped out old tools he maintains. Shittiest carpenter I know has a massive pack out set and brand new tools and didn’t know what a biscuit joiner was.",

I will say - it's so much easier and some much more convenient.  I was on a jobsite this past week - no power.  Didn't have to bring a generator to the site.  Worry about gas.  Listen to it.  Plug in cords.  It saves so much time and effort.  I just bring in batteries every night - make sure they're charged.  And you're good to go.  They have other options - like charging stations and whatnot - but thats expensive af.  Basically a huge ass battery - that you can plug into and either charge batteries or run corded tools.  \n\nBut you're right.  You get trapped.

      "        100% agree, I’m in a position where I will give laborers direction. If I had a younger guy looking at things I’d maybe point out quality work and non quality work and let him know what our role is on the jobsite as a GC, tell him if he/she wants to see how it looks on the drawings to come by after and I’d show him. Then I’d tell him to get back to work breaking down those boxes cause I only estimated 3 dumpsters on this job so make sure you smush that down good.",

I would say expect to be on cleanup, but if you work hard and fast enough they're going to have to find something else for you to help with, because they aren't going to want to pay you to clean up an already well taken care of job site.

      "If you want to be a GC, find a local company and try to hire in as a laborer.  Learn as much as you can while you're helping.  That's how I started.  Six months in, one of their super's called out for a demolition and my bosses asked if I thought I'd learned enough to supervise it.  I said yes and did well enough that they gave me a few more demos to supervise, then they started letting me do more and more - undergrounds, rough ins, etc.  Nine months in I was an assistant superintendent and at a year I was a full fledged superintendent.  Was green af and still had to ask a lot of questions for a while, but after I got the hang of it... I spent six years traveling all over the US supervising commercial jobs.  25$ an hour at first, then forced salary down to 62.5k, left for a competitor who gave me 140k, then just kept hopping every so often when the offers were right.  Was in the 300k range when I tapped out.  The money was great but 255 days a year on average in hotels and never ending 60+ hour weeks burnt me out on the whole thing.  This isn't to discourage you from doing it, it's just letting you know the reality of it.  Some people are built different and enjoy that kind of life.  Just not me.  I'd rather make less, but actually be able to live my life. Lol  Past a certain point, the money doesn't make the quality all that much better.",
      "Quit the free shit straight up! Get out and find projects and talk to the tradesmen about working. That how you get your foot in the door in construction. You’re a grunt so talk to the head grunt and say I want to learn teach me! Gotta go talk to people.",
      "Tough question.   If you had a specific trade in mind, say: plumbing,  then I'd say buy some copper pipes and fitting, learn to \"sweat\" pipes, and also learn pex fittings.   \n\n  But you're undecided.   So you should start learning basic construction names, and codes.  Learn proper safety like using 12ga wire for 20A circuits, 14ga wire for 15A circuits.   What size pipe for a bathroom supply, or pitch needed on drain pipes.   \n\n  You can buy tools needed for any trade.  Step ladders, a 4ft, and a 6ft is plenty.   A good hammer(don't buy a $150 hammer), just a brand name, 16oz-20oz,  straight claw, smooth face works for everything.     A good tape(I use a 16ft for inside trim, a 26ft for basic construction,  a 30 or 35ft for framing).  I love fatmaxes.   A combo square,  or speed square,  good boots, glasses, gloves, and a decent tool pouch or bag.  \n\n  I strongly recommend doing a specialized trade instead of a jack of all trades type worker,  learning the basics of every trade is tough, but doable.   You're behind the curve though, those guys usually know the basics before being able to drive,  because of a father teaching them or the kid just being so into something early.  Starting at 23 is a bit late.   But not impossible.   \n\n  Advice I give any new guy in any site:   don't try to learn everything at once.  Learn 1 thing well, even if it's how to sweep.  Then, once you know it we'll enough to do it second nature like, then learn another thing very well.   Don't try to learn how to do crown one day, then how to roof the next day, then how to frame the day after.  Learn how to frame, decent enough.  Then learn roofing.  Then learn crown.  Spend weeks and months doing them.   You'll need it.   \n\n  Everybody fucks up.   Own your mistakes.   If your boss is a dick and screams at  you, leave.  If he's not a dick, ask him what you did wrong, ask how to do it right.    Admitting mistakes is important,  learning from them can only happen once you've learned what happened,  so don't spend time hiding something that will be found later.    Just say it, \"I fucked it uo, how can we fix it\" and move on.   I've fucked at least 6 things up today alone.  If I were perfect, I'd be worth a lot more money.  Nobody's perfect.    \n\n  Take pride in your work.  Play the long game.   Doing a fantastic job with little to no issues will bring you in more work than any advertising.   Some guys try to get every penny possible.  They never stick around very long.  Be the guy that has customers that when talking at their office, someone says \"I'm thinking about this.....\" and your customer says \"here, call this guy. He's the guy you want, no need to call anybody else\".   That customer base won't short you, won't Rio you off, etc.   Especially if they have bad experiences in the past.    \n\n  And always remember there's always the stereotypical guys on every site, any trade.   The older guy, works well by himself,   the young kid who can't put his phone down, the guy who feels the need to let you screw up, so he looks better, instead of putting the company first,  the bosses kid who shows up late, leaves early, and is paid too much,  and the new guy who is working so hard, so fast, so long, he's along everyone look bad, but by accident.    And others.   You're gunna have to learn to play well, with guys you may not like at first.   Suck it up.   \n\n  I think that's it.",

I’d recommend that you take a bit of time…like an hour maybe, and see if any particular sectors appeal to you and then start calling around, as others have suggested, explain your desire and willingness to begin at the bottom, and keep an open mind about your future. I had a buddy who did 20 years of commercial steel work and then one day saw a crew doing horizontal drilling for fiber optic and he quit his job in a week and then got on with a drilling outfit that does work all over the world. So he’s a seasoned steel worker who now travels all over the place earning between $100k-150k per year and loves it. You literally have 100’s to 1000’s of options and age on your side to boot!

We ended up having to take care of some walkway asphalt, as there was going to be plants there. So we go outside the spectrum of our job, break it all up, keep it separate from our landscaping waste. No biggie. \n\nWe're digging holes down into the dirt to plant in the flowers and shrubs, and we hit a steel mesh, but we need to go deeper than that mesh. I'm assuming it was there because of the asphalt, not quite rebar girth though. I went up to my boss and said hey we got any snips or something to cut up these metal lines?\n\nMother fucker told me to hit it with something until it breaks. \n\nI said I'm not grabbing anything to BREAK the metal. He told me how lazy I was, that I just didn't want to work, and then proceeded to grab a weed hoe. \n\nA ... Weed ... Hoe. \n\nSo anyways, he's just starts whacking. Full reach up, hoe behind his back, slamming it all the way down. Maybe a dozen times. He ended up pulling his back. I asked him again \"sooo, we got any metal snips?\".\n\nHe sent someone to a hardware store to buy some and we had an early lunch.",

If the pile get too big at the surface, the bottom of the bit is just spinning in the dust making excess heat.\n\nWatch their technique with a new bit. When they are done with the hole, see how hot the bit is. It should be warm, but if it's hot they are using it wrong.\n\nI could probably get 1000 holes out of a nice quad tip bit like that... Assuming the rebar hits are minimal... Really shouldn't be cutting through the rebar anyways, it's there for a reason.\n\nEdit: It's honestly incredible how long good steel and carbide can hold up against concrete and masonry. But you have to respect the metallurgy. This goes for any high carbon steel tooling, once you overheat it and change it's temper, you have effectively annealed it and it will perform like a fundamentally different material...",

Steady, smooth will be faster in the end.",
      "A combination is trying to drill to fast ie pushing too hard and the boss buying shitty bit. Those look like the Home Depot Bosch brand. Try a Hilti bit and less pressure on the rebar. A bit should drill rapidly in open concrete but won’t once you hit rebar, you then either need to use less pressure and slow down the process or use a rebar eater bit to through the bar. If you get a rebar eater, use the type that goes in a regular chuck drill, the sds one don’t last unless you can turn off hammer mode on your rotary hammer.",

Sometimes the job requires chewing your way through and this kills the bit. Running too heavy of a duty cycle also kills the bit (giving it time to cool down between holes extends the life). \n\nI would also check to make sure the hammer drill isn’t getting ran so hard that the bearings are overheating and popping out. Every time a carpenter borrows a hammer drill from us it comes back busted because they run it until it’s red hot, don’t replace the grease around the bearings and the bearings pop right out.\n\nTL;DR: Bits get hot.

      "Honestly check the reviews, if it's good quality and it's specifically made for the outdoors then I'd say go for it.\n\nAlso, I used to do commercial landscape maintenance and let me tell ya, using those hedge trimmers will have your arms really really sore (especially when you gotta hold it at the end of the pole and extend your arms all the way out). Plus you'd also have to mulch up anything you trim off of a real hedge, or blow the trimmed pieces underneath the bush if you can. The good thing about this is that it's maintenance free.\n\nAnd I won't lie, I used to hate it whenever someone used fake plants, but one time I tried growing these vines inside. Unfortunately they did not get enough sun where I had them inside and also it was so inconvenient to water them in the high spot they were in (hard to get to and had some technology underneath), so eventually I got some faux vines for my room and it looks great, of course I have many real house plants too. So I guess if you do something like this definitely have some other plants outside in pots or something like that to balance it out.",

Other than that, the only thing I can think of is you might look for a tool that’s more specifically for whatever you’re marking, like a pencil, chalk, or grease. A scribe might be best, depending on the material. It probably wont help, but Japanese carpenters traditionally used flat, bamboo pens that are kinda like a stiff brush… but then you’d need to tote around an ink well. They used ink in their chalk-lines, so they could dip ink out of it for their pens.\n\nI’m a carpenter, so I don’t need a marker very often.

The lower cross piece doesnt have a jack to the bed rail though, so it's being held up by two screws or nails.\n\n\nOn the other side of the cross piece,  it's literally held up by 2 screws. There is no jack. That means when you hit a bump, the ladder bounces up and slams down and puts those two screws into a shear situation. Hopefully they are nails and not screws, there is a difference. I'm just assuming they are screws though\n\n\nYou dad did not use proper straps to tie down the load. That is the rating on that old strapping that's got knots in it? You know you aren't supposed to tie knot in rigging like that correct? Even if you knew the factory rating of that stuff, it needs to be derated due to age, condition, and the fact that it has knots. I like that the front appears to have a piece of twine around it to hold the step ladder.\n\n\nYou say it's staked in to the bed? Ok, so it's not attached with mechanical fasteners in any way?

The side nail puller provides so much more leverage, and the handle shape allows you to pry sideways which can also provide a lot more leverage when your trying to pry to boards apart. It’s been better for me in every way. \n\nIf I was recommending a hammer to a guy in his first couple years of carpentry, I’d tell him Estwing straight claw hands down. If I was recommending a hammer to a career carpenter that has some disposable cash kicking around, Martinez all day.",

I can almost sink a nail in one plop like with a deluge but the titanium is better on the elbow. I entered a nail driving contest stiletto hosted in 2007 at a lumber shops annual party and went to the truck and got my deluge, 6 nails sank in 3.7 seconds, got my first stiletto and never used a heavy framer again. After a few years I mushroomed the face of the titanium but I’m still only on my second hammer head",
      "I had a wood handle 14 stilleto for and a half years,  replaced the handle 3 times (1 broke the other 2 got loose over time) I loved them,  bought a tibone and hated it,  I like the weight at the head,  bought a 16oz stiletto and it wasn’t set properly and quality has gone drastically down hill.  I bought a Martinez recently and I’ll never look back.  It moves things WAY better than a stiletto,  the 5° angle on the head is super nice.  Claws don’t bend or chip when you need to chip some concrete. They’re all around amazing for framing.  I’ll keep the 14 oz stiletto for siding if I ever do it and I got rid of the tibone and 16oz"

      "        The robots doing brick laying or the angry backlash?\n\nI know for a fact that they have brick laying robots without looking it up, my coworkers have told me their experiences and as far as I know, as of this last year, robots can't lay soldiers, because the consistency of mortar it uses slides off the brick and it doesn't work well.  They have also communicated that there are a lot of things with the robots that are problematic and they require a lot of supervision, to make sure that all of the variables stay consistent.\n\nI have also been told from these first hand accounts as well as seeing it online that they have robots that basically 3d print buildings.  So that removes masonry and carpentry for all intents and purposes. Yeah it's here.\n\nOn the job I am on currently they have block laying robots that basically assist in laying double block at a time but require an actual person to pick up and lay the unit that weighs over 100 pounds  each.  They are a best problematic, as they often break down due to simple errors or easy to remedy mechanical break downs that could have been prevented if regular daily maintenance had been done.\n\nI am not saying it won't happen, or isn't.  From my experience though companies are too cheap to buy a robot for 80k and keep putting time and money into it on a daily basis. They want consistent results  with minimal reinvestment.\n\nThey'll have to have support people to make sure everything is working and qualified to build the structure without the robot, because when a piece of equipment goes down on a remote job, they can't just pop a new robot in its place and keep going.  \n\nIt can be days before a robot can be up and working again on our site, and in the meantime guys are laying while the robot is just sitting there getting rained on.\n\nThe bigger problem the construction industry has to face is that noone wants to do the jobs anymore, and those that do start training or apprenticeships don't know what actual work is, not to mention wanting to spend half the work day with their nose buried in their phone or so high they can't even function.",

      "      Worked in robotic automation.  Big selling point is reduced costs. Robots never get repeated stress injuries, they don't need lights, and they don't care if it's too hot or too cold, they never take a lunch break or need to sleep.  If a robot could replace roughly ten workers, it paid for itself in overages from insurance and operational costs, even considering annual PM's and conservative a 10-year service life.  I'm an engineer not a salesman though, so idk if there's fluff in those numbers, but when you're considering the costs of automation, you also have to consider the costs you will save.  \n\nMost of the produce in the US is generated from 3 major companies located in southern California.  One of those companies hired my company to automate their facilities.  They were hand packing everything. Per line, this was 2 people building boxes, 2 people transferring loads of product from bagging to boxing, and 8 people packing boxes and closing boxes,  12 people per line, 11 lines, 132 workers just putting bagged product into a box.  Let's say each worker makes ballpark $30,000/year.  That's $3,960,000 per year in wages. Each line took 3 robots at $50,000 a piece. That's $1,650,000 one-time cost for ten years of service.  One operator was able to supervise 3 lines, so you take 132 people making $30,000/year and replace them with 12 people making $60,000/year.\n\nObviously there were costs of fabrication as well, but the total project cost for those 11 packaging lines was only just north of their one year wage costs.  Now consider each packaging line *doubled* the output of the human line operators, from around 30/boxes per minute to 60/boxes per minute.  Their ROI on the 11 packaging lines was less than two years and projected around $30m in saved costs over the following 8 years while simultaneously almost doubling revenue out of the same footprint of building.\n\nSo then they had us do the same thing with the palletizing portion of their business. It's a similar story, we don't need to rehash it.  Human palletizing became a massive bottleneck for obvious reasons.  \n\nSo *then* they asked us make a robot that could replace field workers.  Put a robot arm on a GPS guided diesel tractor with vision systems and ANT communications for other field bots.  The company subsidized the R&D 51%....so they owned the rights, but my CEO at the time was riding high on two massively successful projects.  They wanted the thing developed in 5 years, we did it in 2 years.  Well, the thing is, the people working inside the buildings are unionized...but the people working in the fields are not.  The economics simply weren't there to replace the field workers with an expensive robot, so they sat on the tech, and we were basically out $250m unrecuperable R&D costs.  Was a drop in the bucket for the produce company, but it caused our business to have to sell to an amassing conglomerate.\n\nAnyway, automation will continue to take over everywhere, and companies are absolutely investing in the future while biding their time on when exactly to pull the trigger.  The moment it's economical, it's implemented, period. The produce picking robot was developed **7 years ago.** Just wait for it. \n\nAnother story I have is this: robot programmers are not fabrication experts.  Lots of robots do things dumb because they're programmed by people who don't do those things.  A welding nozzle shouldn't be 90° to the weld, but on an angle to maintain a laminar wash of inert gas.  Programmers don't know this, but human welders do.  Robot welders are only as good as their programmer's welding abilities. We had an instance of crushing boxes while trying to pack it. Robot grabber product, turn 90, stuff in into box. Packaging flashing would snag the box and ruin it, kept giving us headaches, programmers didn't know what to do.  So I walked over to where they were still hand packing, and what were they doing? Put it in the box, *then* twist. Duh. Make the robot do that same thing, and we go from 60% success rate to 99.5% success rate in the span of 5 minutes.  The line operators were let go literally overnight...not proud of that, but wasn't my choice on how that company treated their employees. The moral of these stories is this: when you're looking at developing automation, consider that subject matter experts aren't always involved through the whole process. But automation is flexible enough that programmers and engineers can deliver a system that a subject matter experts can tune up at the last moment to drastically improve performance.  We see lots of clumsy bots in demos and people scoff how far off the tech is.  It's simply not.  Exponential growth vs linear growth, the last 5% of the project is 95% of the magic.",
      "    You’re never going to replace the human element of construction. \n\nWe need AI to be incorporated into exo-suits that reduce fatigue, help us lift heavy things and can fit in anywhere a human can realistically fit.",
      "    I’d bet that we have the tech to automate block laying perfectly at a typical job site, but as long as we have relatively cheap labor it’s not worth developing it.   \n\nI’m watching a medium size box store being built nearby and there’s a crew of 10 Latinos (no offense) working for a week on footers and block walls. Walls are maybe 70 completed.\n\nWhat’s a week of non union labor cost the builder? 5 grand?  They’ve got more invested in the scaffolds.",
      "      Google Hadrian X.",
      "      Yeah 100% with that analysis.\n\nI'm in Toronto, and housing has gone through the roof.  There's a lot of reasons, but part of it is just plain lack of labour.  All our housing was built by Southern European immigrants who came in the 50s-70s, and now they've all retired, and our new immigrants are all training for white collar work.\n\nThe folks I know in trades all hate how hard it is on their body.  So I'm thinking we may finally be looking at needing robots to at least make the job easier, so people find it more attractive.",
      "        I think the unspoken argument around the influx of illegal immigrants is a desire to keep labor wages down since most Americans don’t want to do that type of work.  Here in the Midwest the most reliable low skilled trade workers are Latino, and they do a great job.  They’re never going to unionize though, and are easily replaceable. \n\nI’m not anti immigration, but I don’t know how to balance wage stagnation against a seemingly infinite pool of cheap labor.",

The fact alone that the contractor didn't use either gravel or rebar raises huge red flags purely because it's surrounding a component that, if no precautions are taken, can completely ruin the (little) structural integrity your concrete has. Mixing that with the weather can result in what you're seeing, which luckily isn't made worse by weeds sprouting through the cracks and making them worse",
      "I'm no expert but gravel and mesh mat - cant just pour concrete.     Get him to talk about a one year warranty while recording him - if you plan to take him to court and can use it.    Get another professional opinion of how it should have been done.   Hopefully you have photos of what he did along the way.\n\nIf you dont want to go to court - probably stain it a color after filling in the cracks.   Might need to fix it over the years and touch it up again etc.\n\nGood luck.",

      "Brush marks are what you want. You don't want slick concrete around a pool.\n\nAs the saying goes, concrete cracks and it looks like they did some jointing to provide it a place to crack. But in some places they didnt...like the crack at the pipe sticking up. That should have had jointing.\n\nFrom the looks of it, there is differential settlement between the pool side and the yard side of the slab. The pool side probably tied into the pool walls while the outside had nothing. It probably should have had a turndown/thickened edge. The yard edge around the concrete probably gets a lot of water run off (rain, pool water, etc.) and its slowly settling while the rigid side (pool wall) stays still. I think that's what is causing the cracks like in photos 8, 9 and 10.\n\nCompacted gravel under the slab would have helped the settlement. As would a wire mesh mat. Rebar would be overkill. These are not necessarily required.\n\nThe 'trapping of water' in the garden bed is harder to argue. Yes, he blocked it in. Yes, there's roof runoff that goes there (downspout). No, in that situation I probably wouldn't have a pool guy install a yard drain to get the water out of there and out to the yard. They should have been smart enough to point this out to you and either 1) offer to put a drain in 2) give you time to get someone else to do it.",

Including houses and pool decks. If that’s not accounted for in the design then the design will fail. As you’re seeing here. \n\nDid you see any form of metal wiring or mesh going into the concrete?  Did they lay down any stone after they cut out the lawn and compacted?  Did they compact?  Because base on the side picture of the pour. I’d bet they just cut out the lawn. Put up some boards as a form. And just poured on top of dirt. \n\nIf you experience the seasons then every freeze-thaw cycle will further frost wedge that deck until it’s in separate pieces.

      "    There are different cure types, temp ratings, expansion ratios, etc. For example neutral cure vs acid cure. Acid cure may stick better to some surfaces, may damage some surfaces, and smells like vinegar as it dries. \n\nCompare the manufacturer specs.

I probably shouldn't even comment this (hearsay) but here's what the 50 years old super who taught me almost everything I know about construction told me re: silicone -\n\nThere are certain finish materials (marble, natural stone, maybe some hand made tiles?) that can be damaged by compounds released by silicone varieties (e.g. window and door in a kitchen/bath application). \n\nWhether true or not I have never bothered to check. Take it with a grain of salt",

This is the first takeoff I’ve done with it with no experience with the tool itself. Overall, I like it. I would say I probably have an hour and a half invested in this drawing while learning the tool. There is some cleanup work, but overall I’m very happy. The ability to add assets is very beneficial to elevations when it comes to wall tile of different products.\n\nIn this drawing, I used elevations to set paint above door frames and also added a chair rail.

They can show you how it works off of their drawings, or you can provide your own drawings and they’ll do a takeoff right in front of you. They move quick though because they know the program inside and out. However, there are videos on YouTube to show you the features.\n\nThey don’t offer trials anymore because the software comes with free lifetime support and training. They found they were spending more time doing the support and training for trial software then they were selling the software so they changed up their business model.

      "      The hell you do. I've been way up in the sky without them. Just use the sky hook to get down if it falls",
      "Certified scaffold erector here! That is mostly correct! However as others have said the outrigger are missing their wheels which means they aren't doing toooo much being there, (if it tips without the wheels you're in for a ride) if you're concerned about rails, 2x4s at about 42\" and 21\"  (+- 3\") above your decking is standard and swing gates are required now a days but on bakers like that I've never seen them. It looks good, I'd say it doesn't necessarily even need the outriggers because of the 4:1 rule or even a 2:1 rule for the mobiles. But bakers are always a bit sloppy and will never feel the most stable. It WILL sketch you out until you get used to them and your body realizes that it's safe. Just make sure you have your safety/gravity pins in and you're kosher!\n\nEdit: after review you could put in some cross braces or goosers/plan braces for a little bit more rigidity but that's also not necessary",

If it lacks outrigger, attach temorary 2x4 braces down to the wall frames..... it's always easier to do stuff like this before you start working up there... if it feels more comfortable, then you will work faster and safer.",

      "Right-about to tip over",

      "    The good part about that is when you fall, you can easily just rub some dirt on it and get back up there",
      "      That one yeah 🤦‍♂️- the others are much safer 😂\nthe set up we had to build on the 6th floor balcony to get to the swing stages after someone called the MOL is minty though 😂 \n( 30’ ladder with retractable to get to a large balcony another ladder on three levels of scaffolding / anchored to the wall with another retractable up then hockey sticks and railings with kickers and then a wood ladder to the swing stages ) 😅😎\n\nSometimes maybe good \nSometimes maybe shit",

      "Those weak rails on these scaffolds are usually useless, I feel like if I were to fall on the rail it would just take the whole unit down with me. I’d rather be able to jump off it if I have to. Put blocks under the outriggers though if you can’t find wheels otherwise they are useless.",

The laborers rigged up a filtration system and all the carpenters cut the tubing for whatever reason. Dust/silica was still everywhere. Did not get amended for weeks.\n\nNo wet saws, hard hats were *optional*, lead paint being used and still present. Constant change orders of the 700+ cameras, doors, and wire runs we had to do. No sitting area for lunch, and you had to eat around trades who didn't take break.\n\nA plumber caused a major leak and hit our IT room. All panels and wiring had to be replaced. Excessive mold grew in the room, forced to work in it. They hired random people from Home Depot with bottles of Fantastik to get rid of the mold.

      "Aim for the project manager; they love talking paint bids",
      "Superintendents, project managers, estimators. I’d probably say in that order. Supers you can typically walk up to on a job site and introduce yourself so they are the easiest point of contact",
      "  Caveat I work in residential cinstruction. If he's calling around imo he should ask to speak to an estimator. If some random joe walked into my office when I was in the middle of something \"as the PM\" i would probably take their card and that would be the end of it - I'd still call my preferred paint sub.\n\nThe estimators are always looking for new bidders. Quality bids are also a way to demonstrably get your foot in the door.\n\nI will also say neither the PM nor the estimator would likely  take a referral from the super for a new sub who walked onsite like off the street or something... Id ask the super why he didn't bounce a stranger off the job site lol",
      "  The super is there to manage the site and the crews. The PM is there to answer major questions and give support to the super. Not to take bids. An estimator is the best bet",
      "If you’re ok with paying some money Autodesk has Building Connected with is basically a private bid board that GCs have the ability to make bids public. You punch in the trades you cover and it will automatically send you bids. It’s heavily used in my area so might be the same for you. They do a 30 day trial so you can see if it works for you. Once someone posts a bid their contact information is there as well so you can follow up or call to try to get in.\n\nAs for who to talk to, from my experience it’s both Estimators and PMs. If you’re bid isn’t used isn’t used in their bid it’s harder to get on the job. Also, lots of companies allow the PM to use what contractors they want. So it’s sort of a double whammy if you can get the estimator to use your price for the scope and then the PM wants to use you once the project moves over to operations.",
      "Lol sounds like the GCs need to hold a meeting and send some emails back and forth just to figure out who OP should talk to.",
      "  Maybe… they take lunch from 10:00-4:15, so they’ll see if they can get to it",
      "Aim for project managers; they steer the ship, mate.",
      "I have been mainly focused in estimating as a GC for 30 plus years. The person you need to be talking to is the estimators. That is who drives who is getting invited to bid. As estimators we pay a bit of attention if a good PM recommends adding someone to the bid list, less so from supers. Fact is, history shows that usually those are \"good buddy\" referrals or just a rando that dropped off a card and often not really qualified or even known. I also try hard to match subs to the project, if all someone has done is smaller interior finish outs I am not inviting them on as multistory hotel for instance, not all do that though. Be honest and upfront with them, let them know your honest capabilities and that your looking for opportunities to work with good GC's and you have heard good things about them. If it is a larger GC and they have an estimating coordinator DO NOT forget about them and treat them well as they are the gatekeeper to the more Sr. Estimators who make the decisions. \n\nLast, as for databases, look into registering with places like Thebluebook and ISqFt. When the GC is setting up his bid it works off of radiuses from the job zipcode and you have a decent shot at getting an invite that way but beware, it is kind of random and in a lot of cases you wont know who your bidding to, look into the company inviting you before you waste time bidding.",
      "Ok I'm a painting contractor and this is what I do to expand the pool. You call one or two estimators in every company you can. You introduce yourself and tell them that you would like the opportunity to be put on their bid list for whatever area you cover. Tell them what services you provide and that you would like to work with them in the near future. They will happily put you on the bid list. Keep track of who you talk to and make it a point to call them every few months to check in. Add them all on LinkedIn so they see you are a real person and not a bum.

There’s all kinds of similar hats for outdoor recreation. I went to REI and tried on every hat in the men’s and women’s sections until I found the best fit. \n\nSome of my coworkers have larger straw hats but they rarely wear them.

Obvious solution is to recast the precast panel to suit but because of the ones they missed, it wasn’t going to be structurally acceptable so they demoed the whole thing and redid it",

And also new boots are stiffer and offer better ankle support meaning a lot of the other things like rolling your ankle or just stepping wrong are easier to recover from because they have actual support. It’s good policy for a company to provide all necessary safety supplies. And boots are safety supplies. Simple as.

Boots are required to be worn but not usually required to be provided by the employer. Some employers do have boot allowances but I think it may be more common in non-construction industries.\n\nAnd, interestingly, site PPE requirements vary a fair bit depending on the GC (general contractor). I recently started on a site with a really big-name GC with somewhat laxer PPE requirements who requires work boots that cover the ankles but does not require them to be safety toe.

      "    I truly love my martinez, especially when setting concrete wall panels. Something about the geometry of the claw is just perfect for that kind of work, not to mention the anti-vibe aspect. I was so impressed that I bought a whole new hammer with the mini-sledge head for driving form stakes and such. That thing is also a champ. Use them both on pretty much a daily basis and if I lost either one I’d have a replacement ordered by dinner time. We all spend $$$ on power tools without a thought, but so many guys balk at the thought of shelling out for a high quality hammer. I don’t get it. But I can’t recommend Martinez enough — their stuff is fantastic!",

One day, a smallish forwarder's rep came by to try to get our business.  He told me that, if I was a football fan, his company had great seats at our stadium in some kind of club thing (not really sure how it works) and if I was interested in going to any games to let him know.\n\nTo make a long story short, all three of my guys were football fans, and i was able to get each one of them two tickets to watch our local team play their favorite team.\n\nI am convinced that, were it not for that rep, I might not be in business right now.

      "As a fellow leader of front line mechanical workers, I love giving my team tools as rewards because they love it too, and it benefits everyone. Makes their job easier, increases productivity, I like giving them and they like receiving them. Ratchet wrenches, head lamps, unique multi tools, nice work gloves or safety glasses…\n\nIt’s a win for everyone. They will love it. Also a homemade crockpot of chili is always a win.\n\nOh, good water bottles! I get my guys new Super Sparrow water bottles every spring. They only cost like $25 each and they are by far the best water bottle I’ve ever bought. Makes it easy for them to stay hydrated and safe in the heat.",

Now, stilettos are in just about every toolbelt there like a dime a dozen at this point,\nI started buying martinez hammers because you can replace the whole head so when you destroy your claws from digging out Gravel over time, you can just buy a new head and the sledge head on it seems cool to pound pins and stakes on the run!",

      "Have you picked it up and used it yourself? Give it a few good wacks onto something solid and see how much it makes your hand and wrist hurt.\n\nMy number one thing on a hammer is always how much force translates to my hand and if i can do work comfortably or not. I will add a disclaimer that even though i've not been tested, i have likely suffered a moderate severity vibration injury and am exceptionally sensitive to vibrations to the point that i almost cannot ride a V-twin motorcycle anymore because they shake too damn much and cause me enough pain that i fear i might crash. Not everyone experiences the force transfer quite like i do, but if it is fairly comfortable to use i'd be absolutely floored that i got something like this gifted to me no matter who gave it.",

      "I worked for a company that supplied everything we needed for free. So when it was time for rewards we went out and all partied together at dave and buster or top golf but we also had tournaments for prizes and usually would spend 4-5 hours at these spots and would walk away with on average 300$ each, full stomachs, slight buzz, and were allowed to order food before we left to take home to our families. The whole crew and management got along really well and because of those things a lot of became close friends through the years and have shared a lot of great experiences together. I was there for 6 years before the company sold since the owners were ready to retire. We also had weekly meetings either at a restaurant or in shop and before we all left in the morning to do our jobs we would take a vote on where to go eat or what to order in and a time that works for everyone to be at said food place or back at the shop. I miss working there sometimes",

I just said ok and dropped it off at another guys house that worked with us and lived closer. It felt real petty. It was a bad ass hammer though",
      "  Sounds like that boss knew the cost of everything and the value of nothing.\n\nMy thinking is that if work is slow and there's not the money to pay through then do everything you can in the hope that when work picks up again there's a chance they'll come back.",
      "If you plan on doing this sort of thing all the time, I wouldn’t set the bar too high. You can maintain high morale with lesser rewards over a long period of time for the same expense instead of one overkill reward once followed by nothing\n\nOr another way to go is make it a Christmas thing and make it badass then it’s more or less the norm when it’s only once a year. \n\nStuff to think about. Morale and long term retention are always tough to manage.",

Just show up and go, “I got you guys new hammers, thanks for your hard work.” \n\nThose that know will be ecstatic and grateful from the jump.

      "I got my Tb3 for free and while I would never buy one I love having it and appreciate the gift a lot. It came smooth faced and I bent (like actually twisted the shaft of 3 Allen keys trying to get the bolt off the face) ended up having to weld an Allen key onto it and twist it to all hell after hitting it with a blow torch to soften up the thread locker . Not so sure but I think welding the hammer killed the magnet that holds a nail to start it because the magnet doesn’t work now. Still love the hammer . I’m a metal framer so I used to use a drywall hatchet and this is my first wood hammer , I got used to the weight distribution and now regular hammers with all the weight on the head seem weird",

      "Totally overkill.\n\nCash would be a lot better",
      "This is a really nice thing you're doing.\n\nAs a guy in the trades myself, having the same exact tool as someone else always ends up with someone losing one and saying someone took it.\n\nGet your employees names laser etched onto the hammers.

      "A good hammer is always a welcome gift, though for concrete I don’t know how optimal those would be. I swing an Estwing, my father swings an Estwing, my foreman swings an Estwing, and it serves us well because of the smooth construction, solid weight, bladed neck, and ease of replacement if the grip ever gives (my own has had no problems for most of a decade). Some guys claim they are hard on the arm joints, but I’ve never found a problem and neither have most of the guys I know. If nothing else, though, those would make nice personal hammers for home projects and be a good symbol of your appreciation.",

Unless you’re just smashing the piss out of it then any hammer is gonna leave an imprint. It’s not titanium, but there’s never any need to replace the head of the hammer. Also, stiletto is no more .

Some people will say it's overkill but in my company probably 90% of the journeyman have a stiletto and we do everything from foundations to finishing with those things. One old guy I work with used to joke that he \"beat everything but his dick and his wife\" with his.\n\nThe TB3 is a bit of a downgrade in quality from the 2 in my experience but they're still great hammers.

I’m clearly confused here. \n\nTo give your employees a hammer is not “overkill”.     To give your employees numerous items that you got for “free” is not overkill.  If it’s a high dollar hammer that you paid for, then I understand the question, and my answer would be that rewarding your employees enrichens their lives, and gives them a sense of family, belonging, and instills loyalty from the appreciation.\n\nEven if that were the only thing it did, it would be the right thing to do from a humanity perspective.

As it's concrete then consider an allowance for two sets of decent boots per year and let your employees select them; the moment I was allowed to purchase my own toetecters was the moment I wore them all day everyday.\n\nMake sure each crew has a decent site radio and if the line of powertools has it; a coffee brewer with resupply bags (creamer, sugar etc.) at base they can grab that will do a whole job.\n\nWhen it comes to bonuses, honestly, it's money that pays the bills, the hammer there looks nice but the bank won't take it in lew of a mortgage payment (in fact they get kinda upset if you run in to a branch waving a hammer about).\n\nAs you get freebies then perhaps ask your crew what tools they want and see if your tool guy can do you a good deal.\n\nA final one that's a bit out there is construction expo's: If there's one near your area then take the crew there for a day paid, with lunch included, let them go off and do their thing with the only proviso to call you to let you know of anything that might be useful to them on the job.

It’s rude but  majority of the time I can let it go. Last week my foreman got out of his truck, walked right over to me why I was putting the plug in the pipe and spit next to my hand, he laughed and went to walk away. I jumped up so fast and freaked out on him. Gave him a big fuck you and walked off. I called my supervisor to let him know I got in my foreman’s face and walked off the job. Supervisor called my foreman and he says it was an accident knowing damn well he did it because he thought it was funny. Embarrassing me in front of traffic control.

      "  Yup. I'm a dude, but I met my now wife in our local. She dealt with alot of shit in an open shop. Belittling and stupid shit. Union don't fuck around. And the bigger contractors will blacklist workers if they are behaving inappropriately. Was on a Turner job and one guy would not stop using homophobic slurs. He was bounced after one warning and can never work for the largest contractor on the planet ever again. Union is the shit. Usually.",
      "  Fuck ya to this",
      "  As a man in the union, I'll gladly throw down for my sisters. We all do the same shit and we all deserve the same respect. I've never understood what's so difficult to grasp about that concept.",

      "  100% agree. Join the union.",
      "  Great answer.",
      "You did not fuck everything up. You reacted to a toxic situation. I used to work for a shitty boss, they didn’t do things like you’re experiencing but mentally fucked with me and wanted me to feel like I was bad at everything I did. I left and got a new job. Everything that my old boss criticized me for, my new boss appreciates. You’ll find somewhere better.",
      "Companies/goverment are spending cash on classes against this kind of shit rn. Kind of thought it a joke but i guess it isn't. Stay positivie because the scum of the earth feeds on shit they saw stick to you. Job search meanwhile.",

      "I’ve been a foreman for 4 years and gf for a year now, and I do believe I’d warn first and then fire someone for throwing a tool instead of handing a tool to an apprentice.  It’s all about respect.  We also don’t do shit talking on my crew. You show each other the respect you deserve. I’m a Union Sheet Metal Worker.",
      "I agree with a previous poster, the guys you work with are the problem.\nShit talk and joking are fine, but everyone knows the line. When it's to demean or hurt or belittle someone, it's over the line. Sounds like that's your daily experience. It's not right.\nAnd kudos to you, I know it isn't easy being a woman in construction.",
      "  Thank you",

With a CDL joining an operators union would be fairly seamless. \n\nMany of the comments are saying to join a union, are you not? Please join if not! \n\nI’m a lady as well, btw.",
      "  Joined the page! I never really did trucking, I had got my license and taught at a school for a few. I have kids so OTR wasn’t an option. Then was asked to come to this company because of my license.",
      "    Gotcha! Totally makes sense lol\n\nSimilar for me too actually. I originally wanted to be a pipe welder (in the dirt/bell hole, my own rig, the whole 9), but I realized that required so much time traveling and I didn’t want to be away from my kid. \n\nGlad you’re part of the sub now! ❤️",
      "I would absolutely lose my shit on anyone disrespecting anyone like that, regardless of gender. Absolutely uncalled for and I’d shove my steel towed boot up their ass and have them ass fired. Shit like that makes construction so toxic.",

      "There are some consequences to standing up for yourself unfortunately, but sometimes you owe it to yourself. A life of getting shit on and disrespected by everybody gets tiring and you do deserve better. Suffering the \"boys club\" is not to your advantage in the long run.",
      "Yeah, that's really shitty from everyone, sorry you had to experience all that.\n\nI like talking shit and having fun at work, but I never understood doing anything mean spirited. \n\nA jobsite is a dangerous place, and ideally we are all brothers and sisters looking out for each other like family. To me, talking shit is a very important part of that because it builds comraderie, and it keeps lines of honest communication open.\n\nI'd say just keep your head down and keep doing good work. If someone fucks with you, definitely try to find a place to approach them and discuss the issue one on one. Ask your foreman why he acted the way he did. Ask if he has any daughters, and how he'd feel if they were treated the same way.",
      "  Thank you",
      "    Tell them to fuck off. Seriously... there is a line, show them where the line is..",
      "    Ignore this advice about keeping your head down. I have been in toxic crews and there is nothing you can do or say that will make these pieces of shit stop. My recommendation is to get the fuck out and go somewhere that deserves you. You deserve to be treated respectfully. \nShit talking and messin around is fine and to be expected in this work, but what you are experiencing is not that. It’s illegal, mean, and potentially dangerous. GET OUT. You deserve better.",
      "Find a new crew and go union. Don’t put up with that bullshit.",
      "I work in construction too, and trust me this happens all the time. Like some people mentioned, if you laugh it off a couple times or ignore it they'll only keep doing it over and over again. It's like entertainment to them. I'm glad you walked off that job and told him to fuck off. I would've done the exact same thing. You deserve a better company or union that will take care of you, stand up for you. But most of the time,  I've given them no attention back, or given them a gross look, or catch their eyes staring, they feel stupid and embarrassed immediately. Show them who you are, hell maybe be honest and say you hate working with them for etc reasons. I'm proud of us girls working in the trades. It's really not easy, and we do deserve so much better. You'll find the perfect fit one day, just keep looking. Don't settle",
      "  Thank you",

      "You did the right thing no guilt in doing that no one blames and if they do their dogs begging for the wrong type of attention You can't blame yourself for them they been taught wrong and only one way to manage that. You are worth more than that. Lift yourself out of this \" it's my fault cycle\"  it ain't you. No one wants to live with the attitude no one deserves the flack. You did the right thing walk proud stand up they can't knock you down.",

      "Get with a crew that values you for you. I've been in construction for 20 years and it is FULL of farm agile masculine douche bags. So much so I opened my own general contracting company and now those assholes beg me for work, and believe me, I do not hire them. \n\nIt's the bigger well known construction companies that do this. Find yourself a small outfit doing what you do or close to it, you'll be so much happier.",
      "Next time someone drops the tool they are handing you on the ground,go pick up his or her toolbar and take it to the toilet,shit in it,put it back where it was and walk off the job to find a new one,nobody needs that shit and it's not acceptable.is this union your speaking of?",
      "Your co workers sound like horrible people.",
      "This isn't your fault, I've lost my cool for much less. Sounds like your foreman is a cunt and he's doing it because he's a bully. He would get his jaw rocked doing that with the lads I work with. \n\nQuit your job immediately and find something better dedicate all your time to that instead of wasting anymore time with these cunts.",
      "Sounds like a toxic crew. I started bringing my anger home because of the crew. I realized the same thing. If you weren't part of the fishing crew, you were ostracized.\nI quit and it was the best choice.\nGet the fuck out",

      "Your site and company sound terrible and stuck in the 80s. I'm a construction manager and the foreman would be getting ripped a new one if he tried that shit (along with disciplinary action). Site morale is important and the way they are acting is doing anything but building that team trust",
      "Fuck those guys. You need to get off Reddit and on indeed.",
      "Shit like that would end with my pliers in their face. Fuck them. Drive the truck somewhere weird and then quit.",
      "On behalf of all respectful men, we are sorry you have to deal with those good for nothing slobs. Id continue to be loud and let em know youre pissed and wont shell up. \n\nThats so disrespectful to throw tools on the ground to you etc etc. Thats not fucking around",
      "Fuck those guys, get on a crew somewhere else. Job is hard enough without having to deal with that. If someone threw a tool I asked for on the ground, there would be an unpleasant lesson in respect coming there way immediately.",
      "In all honesty, you did it right. Same shit happens in the military all the time. There is only so much you can take. Its better in the long run that you said something because the situations you can get sucked into go to far without repercussions.",
      "Fuck all of that. Jump ship and let them sink without a qualified operator. In the US, spitting at someone can be considered assault. I used to work in EMS, and I've pressed charges against patients who spit at me.",
      "Join the union my friend. Sorry to hear.",
      "Nah you didn’t fuck up you did the right thing. If anything you should have filed a harassment and discrimination lawsuit long ago. You should document this shit and bring it to a lawyer. If upper management is aware and involved in this you could sue them big time. \n\nThey do this shit cuz they think they can get away with it. Cause they know if they treated the wrong person that way they’re getting punched in the face real quick. \n\nIf this is how they act to your face imagine what they might be doing or saying behind your back. You haven’t been taking this seriously enough.",
      "This is straight BS, stand your ground get your experience and get the hell out. You fucked nothing up .I’m a female and in a leadership position in large scale construction projects ($1Bn+ type jobs). Our female crews are the most productive out of any of them, our female haul truck drivers are the best, we actively try to hire as many woman as we can. Unfortunately some men just suck and see us as not welcome in the industry. Even at a leadership level I get so much shit. I’ll never forget back when I was a PM, a VP who used to be a submarine commander screaming in my face and threw all his paperwork on the floor….. my only choice was to scream in his face throw my paperwork everywhere and then ask him if we were going to the parking lot to fight 😂 I’m like barely 5’4. I held my ground and then when I got back to my office I cried (never let them see you cry) However, he never did it again. Unfortunately as woman in this industry your going to come across this a lot, it’s not right but it happens, I just hope it changes for the next generation.",
      "This is a hostile workplace environment. Almost textbook. Also - feels retaliatory to sideline you over legit complaints.",

      "Oh god that sounds horrible.  Sorry you work with such assholes.",
      "This is bullying and harassment. \n\nI would have snapped in 10 seconds if anyone did this to me… if someone was taking pics of me and spitting next to me, I may have given an old-school beat down.\n\nGet the fuck away from these people and NEVER tolerate this again… no, regular workers do not do this.",
      "What is wrong with guys? I'm a carpenter and I wish more women would get into construction because lately I've been finding most of the guys I work with have little or no skills or knowledge.  Feel if there were more people out there we could get people to try harder.  There is absolutely nothing about construction that women couldn't do just as well if not better than men.",
      "You’ll pull through this. Glad you set boundaries.",

      "Same experience. First job was with a bunch of rednecks and ex-cons. No experience. No one to stand up for me. 90% of the emplyoees were pretty cool, but those 5 dudes that wanted to hurt me had me acting like a kicked dog. It took ten months for me to realize I shouldn't have to ingratiate myself with people willing to use slurs and imply violence to assert authority.\n\nMy second and third jobs in the same industry were filled with great people.\n\nAlso, what's up with spitting on peoples' work? Do all assholes have a spitting fetish?",
      "Sorry you had to deal with that and I agree with others, find a new place to work. That is inexcusable behavior. I work with women fairly often and if they were treated like you there would be a very big problem on our jobs. \n\nOne of my old coworkers that was in his late 50s decided to say something about a woman operating a roller compacting subgrade. They were having issues getting compaction and he was trying to make a joke but everything he says rubs people the wrong way and just sounds like him being a dick. The joke went something along the lines of \"I guess women don't know how to use a roller, we haven't had any issues before you started\" (it was a man running the equipment up to this point). When it was brought to my attention he was removed from the job within the day and basically forcefully retired (he was given the shittiest work we could find until he got so pissed off he quit / retired).\n\nThat shit is unacceptable.",
      "I've dealt with some bs being a woman on the site but this feels like more than that. \n\nPlease do not feel bad for standing up for yourself and calling the super. These guys won't ever change if they continue to get away with their crap. Plus, spitting basically on you isn't hazing, it's borderline assault. Throwing your tools on the ground is insane.. those things aren't cheap and I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate the same being done to their stuff. \n\nLike a lot of others have said... go Union. Not saying that'll solve those issues (though, they won't be to that extent) but you'll have your BA as back up when someone steps out of line. \nIt sounds like you may have some solid experience behind you so you may be able to bypass the apprenticeship and get journeyman pay right off. \n\nPlease protect yourself and do not ever feel bad for putting them in their place.",
      "Sound like jagoffs. Theres a difference between hazing a little and being a prick. Think you'll be better elsewhere..",

      "Yo. Enough of that bullshit. I’m happy you called upper management. Get the hell out of there and find a company that appreciates you",
      "As a pipefitter with a CDL you would be treated like royalty on my jobsites. You didn't screw things up, a higher power has a better plan for you...you just haven't found it yet. This company should be publicly shamed and run out of business.",
      "Don't let anyone make you feel bad about doing the bare minimum in response to a bunch of insecure little boys at your job. There are great crews out there where people will take time to train you, care about your safety and value your effort and eventually, expertise. And also lovingly call you a dipshit. \n\nDon't let the bastards get you down.",
      "If my crew done someone like this it would be their last day on the job, that is disrespectful as hell and I worry all the time of something like this happening and it not reaching me, that supervisor is glad you called him, they are the ones that dosent belong there",
      "You did the right thing. My teenage daughter wants to join the military, and I'm scared to death she will experience assault or mistreatment with no appropriate responses from leadership. At least if she experiences this in civilian life, I'll know who's door to start kicking down. \n\nSounds like a new work scenario is in your future.",
      ">Like when they go to hand me a tool and throw it on the ground so I have to go pick it up,\n\n\"Hey dipshit, you dropped something\" and then stand there and wait for them to hand it to you. And when they don't?\n\n\"baby boy, I'm paid by the hour. We can do this all. Fucking. Day.\"\n\nThe taking pictures thing is weird also. Just ask them \"you taking a picture so you can verify my dick is bigger than yours later?\"\n\n\nThe spit thing though... Yea, nah bro. They can fuck all the way off on that.",
      "Fuck that foreman and the company for that matter. I'm a superintendent and one of those \"old ass guys\" that people talk about but if that happened on my site that person would be gone.\n\n30 years ago when I was a younger man that shit wasn't acceptable. You were right to stand up for yourself. It's guys like that who ruin the industry because they can't or WON'T adapt to the tines we live in now.\n\nSome joking around is expected in our industry, being an asshole is too but there's lines that shouldn't be crossed and thats one of them.",

      "Legitimately quit, why would you put up with that shit, I’m a man and if I was treated that way I would no longer be with them. You will be treated better than that in literally any other job that is fucking insane.",
      "I’m not sure why but I guessed you are a woman before you said you are\n\nEdit: then I read the rest and it sounds like sexual harassment. I would go union like others have said you shouldn’t have to take that crap",
      "This is utter bullshit. I run a Resi GC company and my crew is mostly men with some women here and there. Nothing like this would be tolerated for one single day on my sites. \n\nTalent is hard enough to find that I suggest you think about working somewhere that values you and can provide basic human respect",
      "Fuck that shit. You deserve better. I've worked with several female fitters on my crew and they've always been treated with respect, at least as far as I can tell. I'm used to field work and the shop I'm at now is also great towards the *whole* crew based on merit alone.\n\nDitch those pricks. Find a place that actually values you.\n\nI'm so sorry you had to go through that. I'm a 6'2\" white male so I don't know dick about adversity, but I've worked with some truly awesome women who obviously dealt with shit too until they learned the skill and confidence to persevere.",

      "Holy hell.. I’m a woman and a union carpenter apprentice, and I’ve never experienced anything like this type of targeted harassment. I’m so sorry you’ve experienced this. I would’ve probably lost it if I was in this situation too. \n\nI definitely think you should join a union. The union will fight for you in the event that contractors pull shit like this.

      "You either deal with abuse or stop it, you put them on notice to stop it. A line was crossed, that was just disrespect. If the man has a wife, pretty sure he wouldn’t like another man spitting near his wife, that would probably be a fist fight with someone.",
      "Like many others are saying OP, you deserve better than this. Like you, I can joke around and take some shit talking but a line needs to be drawn and what they're doing is straight up disrespectful. I've gotten into fist fights at work for far less when I was young and stupid. Now I'd do exactly what you did, and let the foreman or supervisor handle that shit because they know I'm here to work not fuck around.",
      "Honestly I’d jump ship. They’re not the only construction company out there making bids. There’s work and opportunity everywhere in the trades.",
      "They're trying to get rid of you. \n\nAs guys, we all talk shit, but throwing a tool on the ground and expectantly looking at another man to pick it up would be the fastest way to turn a jobsite into fightclub. So would spitting at someone. \n\nMorality and consequences aside, that level of disrespect calls for immediate physical violence.",

      "i’m sorry you gotta deal with this. you have a shit crew. i’ve only worked with a few women in the field, but every single one has impressed the hell out of me and all the guys. it takes some balls to do what you do. and while no working woman is immune to standard job site shit-talking and things of that nature - this is different, way over the line, and any dude acting like that to a woman (or a man for that matter - but it’s a little different) in a crew of mine would have had ten boots on his ass in a matter of seconds.",
      "You should be calling. You’re experiencing sexual harassment. What you failed to do is be clear enough to upper management that it was sexual harassment that needed addressing. There is probably a very clear sexual harassment policy. You’re not letting upper management know you got in the foreman’s face and walked off the job. You’re letting upper management know you’re the victim of a steady stream of sexual harassment. The last straw event is not the real issue here.",
      "If you have the resources you could go to school and become an inspector and get around to busting their balls endlessly instead, could be fun.\nIn all seriousness though, at least find a better company or go union. Don’t put up with that shit, there’s no point hating work everyday.",

This was not an accident that he did this on purpose laughed about it, and then walked off, confront them and be done.\n\nIf everybody is treating you this way, just be the one that stands up for yourself and just say why what is it that you think is OK about what he did.\n\nThe entire Cruise treating you this way then I would take a step further and go to the owner of the company and tell him this is a big problem and people shouldn’t be treated this way male or female \n\nI can tell you there’s a reason why the industry that people are called. I’ve been one my spouse and both of my children. \n\nAnd believe me, you don’t learn anything about your apprenticeship programs because you were literally just there to wipe and pick up other peoples crap all over the floor room and the second after you graduate your first school you start learning more and more about the electrical industry \n\nBut even as a grunt, they don’t disrespect you. They just expect you to do what they ask you to do.\n\nI can assure that most women that are in the field nowadays do not get treated this way as the men usually hold the women in respect",

      "This is actually a common problem with active wear too. They will smell fine when they come out of the dryer but after short time of wear they start putting off a funk.  More often than not its from scented fabric softener.  Fabric softener is just scented fat. It provides food and helps trap the same bacteria that make smells, soon as the scent wears off thats what you're smelling. Also, the oils used in scented liquid detergent tend to trap the stink and bacteria on fabric as well. I use a powdered nonscented detergent like Nellie's washing soda or Oxyclean and i havent had smells since. I used to work in a foundry and had to sit through a safety class about maintaining and washing our FR clothes, mostly boring but the dude gave weird but useful laundry information.",
      "The other comments of oxyclean, vinegar and Lysol sanitizer are good and could help. If that doesn’t work, you can try laundry stripping them. It removes anything built up on clothes, towels, sheets, etc, that doesn’t really get removed in the wash. Oils, dirt, stuff like that. I use vinegar or oxiclean a lot of times when I do laundry. I never use fabric softener anymore because it just builds up on your clothes and washer. \n\nTo strip your laundry, fill up your bathtub or a large tub with hot water, as hot as will come out of the faucet. To the water add 1/4 cup Borax, 1/4 cup arm & hammer washing soda, and 1/2 cup laundry detergent. Some people add oxiclean and a squirt of dawn also. Submerge all the clothes and let them sit for 4-5 hours, until the water cools. Stir the clothes around every hour. The water will look really dirt and gross. Wring the water out of everything and then toss them in the washing machine without any laundry detergent or anything else added and dry like normal after. That should help. \n\nI also buy washing machine cleaner and run it in my washer every month or 2. I like the tide one better than afresh brand personally. My washer has a cleaning cycle, if yours doesn’t just run the longest hottest cycle with just the washing machine cleaner in the tub. Then I wipe down anything that looks gross around the seals, door or in the tub. That helps get anything built up in the washer. Hope this helps!",

I (the homeowner) signed a contract for an addition which included a line item estimate for most big things (i.e. plumbing, electrical, cabinets, etc.), including the GC O&P. At the time of signing, I mentioned to the GC that I would like to use my own cabinet shop. He said \"sounds good, let's talk about it when the time comes\".\n\nWell the time has come, and the position he has taken is whether I use his shop or the one I would prefer, his is entitled to his O&P AND another 15% because I would have only gotten 85% of that line item worth of material.\n\nThis doesn't feel right, I am open to giving him a portion of the O&P but he is doing no work and will not be doing the install.\n\nIf you are a GC, how would you handle this?

      "So you here for confirmation that you are right?\nYou entered into a contract for the entire scope of work. The contractor is entitled to his overhead and profit in the total scope whether he is performing it or not. Now it’s convenient to change scope for you to save money. Not his problem. \nHe may not have not expressed this tactfully but for you to say you are offering him a bone doesnt fly. \nNow you claim you did all the work. Lol , to justify your actions. You dishonest",
      "  Homeowner scum always try to change the deal after the fact. They deserve everything they get",
      "So he wants to keep 15% of the line item plus the full O&P that was originally included? I am a GC and I think that's unfair. I could see him keeping the original O&P if he's going to coordinate and possibly supervise with this cabinet maker, but he's trying to squeeze you for cash.",
      "  O&P is one thing - GC should keep that.\n15% from line item - THATS A MANAGEMENT FEE",
      "  Hi - Thanks for the quick reply! That's correct. His exact comment was \" I don't work for 18.5%, I work for 33%\" - I proposed paying him 10% for whatever coordination he had to do but he has no contact with the cabinet shop. I am the middle person. I know it's hard to tell without seeing the contract but I thought I could just choose to not do that line item with him and it would all go away.",
      "Are you going to be the one to do all the work with YOUR sub? Meet him on site for measurements?, coordinate with Plumber on locations?, Electrical on Location and placement of outlets to coordinate with cab's as well as equipment? Are you going to be the one on site on day of delivery? Are you going to be onsite during install to ensure it all goes in correct? Are you going to be onsite to make decisions if something isn't quite fitting? I could keep going but hopefully you get the idea. \n\nTypically the answer to all of that is no. The only thing he is not going to do is write a contract, and he may even have to do that, and pay the sub, the rest doesn't change and that is what your paying him for. HE is owed his fee on the original cost of the work he had with his sub as well as additional markup on any additional costs above that amount.",
      "  Hi Grim -\n\nThe funny part about this situation is I would answer YES to every single question you posed and I would be paying the shop directly.\n\nI would also add that when the HVAC, Plumbing, and Electrical Rough in's were happening who was the one there making decisions on where outlets go, where ducts go, where  gas lines go, where the dryer will sit, which vents the framers messed up, etc. It was ME.\n\nI get your point which is why I offered something, unfortunately, some GC's are not as active as you",
      "That's what you get for not vetting your contractor right. Hope he leaves your shit cracked open. Penny pinching homeowners",
      "This could go both ways. As a GC, we allow our clients, occasionally, to purchase certain items. Those are usually written into our contract and scope of work though, as “owner provided.” We don’t mark those items up. But, also, if something is wrong with those items when they show up to be installed, it’s on the homeowner to deal with it.\n\nThis sort of an arrangement doesn’t usually turn out great for either parties, but based on a previous post in this thread, sounds like your contractor hasn’t been very active in his part of your job, so it’s a bit tough to say exactly how to handle this specific situation.",
      "this depends on what your contract says regarding changes, often the owner reserves the right to delete portions of the work which results in a reduction to the total contract price and the contractor is not necessarily entitled to recover anticipatory profits and overhead on deleted work\n\nwhat does your contract say about changes?"

Your willing to take a general labor position  go show them what you can do. Show up everyday with all your PPE , a good attitude, willing to work. Try to see the big picture and how your task contributes. Ask for an evaluation, after a few weeks. Good help is hard to find. If it’s for you they will keep you.

For the restaurant kitchen and bathroom I need to drop quite a few vertical pipes down to the garage and tie them into the waste system and install a grease interceptor. With the conduit runs where they are, I have no real space to drop my drains that would require moving those conduit, which is probably not happening as it would be stupid expensive and the apartments are occupied.

It's fine that you don't have your head wrapped around all that's involved, but jus to say, you would have to shut down parts of an entire apartment building to pull out wires, redo the conduit, then pull new longer wire back in the conduit.

You shut off what you need to work on and You can do everything from the gear outside (or inside) and that utility area, throw a temp generator on the unit youre working on off one half of the junction and the power to the unit wont even be interrupted for very long\n\nIm not saying its not work, but the work is easy and the problem is simple....\"10s of 1000s of dollars\" like someone else said  my ass lol",

      "          Yup, started in my family’s cabinet business and now I am a GC. Most times I think your best bet is to work WITH your contractor prior to engaging a designer, if your GC is reputable and experienced he is going to be able to tell you what is feasible within your budget and as a customer you should be spending your time making specific choices and and wants vs needs. Functionality trumps everything, design and aesthetics are important but definitely secondary or tertiary.  I’d would personally rather see a customer keep that money in their pocket or apply it towards upgrading cabinets/finishes.  I’ll never tell a person what color something “should be” it’s your home not mine. My job is too execute on YOUR vision within the bounds of reality or physical constraints.  But it’s the age old argument like engineers/installers vs architects.  I think if you want to be a designer you should be required to spend some time in the trades or at the very least you should have to take some trade related courses.  Otherwise, like you stated you are great at choosing pillows, fabrics and finishes that anyone can do.",

One in 12 men cannot.\n\nYes, designers should spend time in the trades and it goes back the other way as well.

I also don’t claim to be a designer just like I don’t claim to be an engineer even though I can usually ballpark their recommendations based off past experience of their recommendations for load, etc.  I do think it’s funny that you quote “1 in 12 men cannot…” funny that is the exact number of men that are also color blind…..but I digress lol",

      "  Im okay with not always buying the best cuz sometimes the difference between brands when it comes to quality vs price is minimal. That being said if you do a lot of gas piping these grooved ones as well as the flat ones are nothing short of amazing. After awhile the grooves get filled with pipe dope and other gunk but a good cleaning makes them good as new. Almost zero wear after using them daily for 2 years. They are an essential tool for any plumber/hvac tech imo and if you arent using them by now you are doing yourself a disservice.",
      "    Agreed.  I was a Channellock guy for a while until I borrowed my coworker’s Knipex.  Went and bought a pair that afternoon.  Now most of my hand tools are Knipex.  \n\nThe only problem is their pliers.  I find myself being EXTRA cautious when I use them cause I don’t want to blow up a $60 pair of Lineman’s. Lol.",

I just bought a couple new cordless power tools, knipex is next.  Im just not sure where to buy them in Canada, so I'll probably have to order online.",

Channel locks suck if they are not us, and not flat.  I'm just realizing I'm fucking with those things way too much.\n\nThe vice grip ones are pretty good though, at least they don't fall out of the channel every time you need to move.",

They're honestly really nice, especially since all the (formerly) American companies are running to China to turn bigger profits. I just can't get behind them when I have Channel Locks. I admit they're better, but mine are American and I've owned them since before I became an apprentice (now jdub).

It was around $75-100 for the parts and labor in a very high cost area. These things are bulletproof and we still use them on our job sites, love them. Unfortunately I can’t give any really good info on model numbers because it’s out on a job now, but I would say reach out to your locally owned shops and see if they can repair them for you.",

      "\n\nFor houses in remote or unusual locations like this, plumbing can still be achieved, but it requires some creative engineering:\n\n1. Water Supply:\n\nWell Water: The house could have a well drilled into the island to access groundwater.\n\nRainwater Harvesting: The house might collect rainwater, which can be stored in large tanks and filtered for use.\n\nWater Piping from Shore: There might be a buried or submerged pipeline bringing water from a nearby mainland water source.\n\n\n\n2. Wastewater (Sewage):\n\nSeptic Tank: The most common solution for homes on islands or isolated areas is a septic tank system. Wastewater is treated on-site, with solids settling in the tank and liquids draining into a leach field.\n\nHolding Tank: Another possibility is a holding tank, which would need to be periodically pumped out and emptied by a service.\n\nComposting Toilets: If running water is not easily available, composting toilets may be an eco-friendly alternative, requiring minimal water and converting waste into usable compost.\n\n\n\n3. Gray Water:\n\nWastewater from sinks, showers, and laundry could be handled separately, possibly being filtered and reused for irrigation or other purposes, depending on local regulations.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these methods requires specialized installation and maintenance but is feasible even for isolated homes like this one.",

    "Title": "Is my man-power supe gaslighting me?",
    "Content": "I’ve been working for a local GC since April. Back starting in May, for a few weeks, a small crew of us carpenters and laborers were tasked with clearing out an ACTIVE HOSPITAL building of furniture and whatnot so it could be gutted and then torn down to build something new. We were pretty much unsupervised by any foreman, and one laborer was causing trouble. The rest of us did our own thing and would work, and the laborer was exploring, tearing things up, doing bad shit knowing the building would get taken down. It got to the point I witnessed him pulling his pants down and pissing on the carpets. Mind you, we were in a hospital building, and other trades would have to come into the rooms behind us to gut it out, including the carpets. \n\nIt got to the point I was in an elevator shooting the shit with other tradesman, and they made a joke about how they can’t work behind our guys because it always smells like piss. This freaked me out. I did not want to be associated with this, as I’m new to the company and have a child on the way. After a few days of contemplating with my wife and friends, I decided it was best to bring this situation to my foreman rather than deal with it myself. I talked with him, and he honestly seemed reluctant about dealing with the issue. Whatever. I asked him to keep me COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS to the crew. I didn’t mind if I needed to be asked by upper management, but I did not wanting the crew or carpet pisser to know. He agreed. I then called the man-power supe and just asked if I could be moved to a different crew. I did not want to go over my foreman’s head about how he deals with the issue, so I didn’t mention any of what happened to the man-power supe. \n\nI get put on a new crew and didn’t hear anything about the situation until today. I get a call from the carpet pisser. He pretty much tells me that in the last few months, instead of dealing with the issue internally, my old foreman had been gossiping about it to everyone he could open his mouth to. It finally circled back to carpet pisser, and the foreman tells him that I’m the one that blabbed. Carpet pisser isn’t mad at me, but asks if it does get to upper management, if I’d lie and tell them I was mistaken. He wants me to tell them he was fake missing and just used a water bottle with a hole. I won’t even lie for myself, and there’s no chance I would for him. I tell him I don’t want to be apart of it. He keeps insisting, and honestly kind of harasses me about it. \n\nWe get off the phone, and I’m livid and also pretty upset. My new foreman can see I’m visibly upset, and she asks what’s wrong. I just straight up tell her everything that happened. She says I need to call the man-power supe and tell him everything. I thought it was a good idea, but she instead goes straight to our crew superintendent and tells him everything. I’m not mad at her for doing this at all, but also I was not included in the conversation. I then get a call from the man-power supe, and he wants to know what happened. I first ask him if he heard about the carpet pissing, to which he replied “I heard rumors of it yes, but didn’t think it was true.” So I give him the details. He tells me that he’s going to deal with the old crew and make sure they aren’t harassing me and then deal with the situation in general. \n\nBut I was super shocked by what he explained next… he told me that next time this happens, I need to deal with it myself and not go above the carpet pisser’s head. He told me his Christian values teach him that confronting someone myself instead of going to management could “create a brotherly bond” between us. He asked how I’d feel if he told on me for doing something stupid at work. \n\nI said “it wouldn’t be an issue because I’m not doing stupid things at work. I wouldn’t be so immature as not to accept the consequences of my actions either.” He doubled down and kind of gaslit me into believing that me telling management that someone is pissing on the carpet in a hospital was the wrong of me. My new foreman and crew-supe were pissed that he said this to me. \n\nAnyways, I don’t know how the situation was handled between my man power supe and the others. Something did happen because a coworker called me saying shit hit the fan. \nI’m not happy at all with the man-power supe and feel like he is completely wrong, and this management style WILL affect someone in the future. Do I get my union rep involved? Do I just jump ship to a new company? Is this an overreaction and the situation is settled? I don’t feel like it was honestly. ",

You’ll definitely have to open this more, remove anything that’s not wood, then replace those wood parts that show signs of rot (studs, joists, sheathing). For those that just have superficial mold, I’m sure there is some product like Kilz primer that will let you encapsulate what mold is left."

      "This is a common issue for entry level office engineers/project engineers/whatever your company calls it.\n\nWhat separates the good entry-level folks from the bad is admitting you don't know it and not pretending you do.\n\nMy recommendation is three fold. \n\nOne....get training from your supervisor. If they are worth a damn, they have sat in that seat and done what you are doing.\n\nTwo....cut the sh\\*t and talk to the subcontractor about their system. Tell them you don't know how it works and what to look for. Most in the industry WANT to share their knowledge with you. Getting you comfortable with their system will help them when you can play defense against the owner/architect/engineer for them.\n\nThree....go see the system as its being installed. See the products be delivered, managed, installed, tested, commissioned. Understand the issues that arise on a daily basis for that subcontractor. Know what the GC is doing on a daily basis that affects your subcontractors. Walk in their shoes.\n\nWhether you want to be a PM, Super, Estimator, QC guy, Safety guy. Doesn't matter.

In addition to what tetra00 said, M/P systems are complex, and it sounds like you were thrown on as the point person for those systems with minimal training so far. Of course you’re going to be overwhelmed, these aren’t beginner friendly scopes to manage. \n\nI felt in over my head my first two years. Honestly even as a leader now, imposter syndrome never really went away, you just learn how to manage it. \n\nI have mentored many PEs over the years, and expect little out of them the first year other than slow and steady progress. \n\nStick with it, try to learn something new every day, and have patience with your development. You’ll get it, it takes time though.",

      "        Interesting. I want to learn as much as I can so I’m glad I’m doing it, I’m just concerned I’m gonna pass on a bad submittal and lose the project time",
      "          It happens. No matter how good you are or how much experience you have.\n\nHell, even the architect/engineer miss things during their review then you get into a battle of submittals vs. contract documents. \n\nI would talk to your PM about 'level of effort' on each of your submittals. If you are reviewing product data for PVC piping or a widget that's submittal is the exact same model number shown in the specs, its probably not worth a lot of time. If you are reviewing AHUs, ducting plans, piping plans, etc., those require a little more time.\n\nLooking at this a different way (and going back to my first comment). You are the person on your team (GC) that should know more than anyone about the plumbing/HVAC systems for that project. If that means you go to your plumber's office/trailer and get schooled on all things plumbing, do it! If your PM asks you about how a system works, where its at in production (released? shipping? etc.), or how other subcontractors tie into that system, you're the guy (or gal)! You should know their contract inclusions/exclusions like the back of your hand.",
      "  They should be, but this is how it used to be, not how it is anymore unfortunately. Unless you work for a big GC who has had long term subs that know their shit. It’s unbelievable how the industry has changed, but 9/10 we have to literally hold our subs hands and explain to them what a submittal is, what a safety plan is, what a shop drawing is.

      "  A fair deal of what we do is assembling stuff that comes off our cnc's, but we also make a bunch of the parts we need",
      "    Yep, classic move: cut salaries, which is effectively what they’re doing if they’re not even adjusting salaries to match inflation every year, of the people you know already do a good job and don’t need to be trained.. maybe some of them find out, maybe some of those that do find out quit, oh well, think of all the money you saved by underpaying market rate. The job listing for your exact job, with a slightly different title, is closer to the real market rate. \n\nPretty much every single company ever created that gets big enough uses this tactic. They love to shoot themselves in the foot for quarterly gains even at the expense of their own long term existence. Retaining talent is a hell of a lot less expensive, treating your people well and paying them fairly makes them want to do a good job and they take pride in their work, not to mention just makes employees lives objectively better. \n\nBut you can’t measure employee satisfaction in quarterly profit, it’s more nebulous than a number on a line chart. Companies will do anything and everything if, for a short time, shareholders quarterly profit goes up. They’re never satisfied, even with n% growth annually: it always has to be at least n+1%. So they’ll keep doing nonsensical things like this chasing infinite growth, until they fail. That’s late stage capitalism for you.",
      "      Yep. And it's super frustrating, because the company had a reputation for treating its people really well, and there used to be talks about turning it into a workers collective when the owner retired. Then they hired a new guy into management, started *paying* for him to go get an MBA, and everything got worse after that",
      "Are you a carpenter or a cabinet maker?  There is a difference",
      "  A bit of both? Historically, our main clientele was theaters, so I do a fair deal of framing out flats and platforms and stuff, but we've pivoted hard and now most of what we do is museum work, so I'm making cabinets and vitrines and higher end, higher quality work",
      "    Then you should be paid at least what they want to pay a bench carpenter",
      "      Oh, I agree! It would just be a $2-$5/hr raise for a lot of us, so I wanted to double check before people got too excited",
      "        They did the same thing earlier this year with the Job Leads, hired on people at $2-$5/hr more than what the current leads were making, so it's not surprising they're doing this",
      "If you are at a bench doing carpentry, I'd say you are a bench carpenter, whatever they want to call it.",
      "  See, there's like 30 carpenters or so and only 13 of us have benches, the rest of us work at tables soooo /s",

Instead of moving the first section of wall would it be possible to erect the second section 6” back from the first section to miss the outlet or will the wall lose too much structural integrity and end up being flimsy?",

It had a keep built back against the hillside, but lower than the main castle walls with a big promenade lined with trebuchets aimed to rain down on the river or the approach.  The towers of the castle had gun ports for the early cannons covering a range of fire for anyone that could get within 100 yards of the castle.  \n\nDuring the 100 years war, it changed hands 7 times.

I bet it’s nice knowing you’re prolonging the life of really nice buildings that were lucky to have in this country with all their history.\n\nMy old man used to do interior restoration work on historical buildings, mainly frescos etc. and his favourite story to tell is when he caught a prolific lead and historical buildings vandal trying to remove a ~30kg gargoyle from the narthex roof (on his own) of a church he was working at. The chap had no idea there was restoration being done and was incredibly brazen. He knew no one should be on the roof removing anything so called the police… who asked if there was any way he could (“reasonably safely”) delay the gentleman’s departure, and he replied that he could just remove the chaps ladder because he was busy on the roof at present and probably wasn’t going to fare too well jumping off the roof to escape… and so he did. He was arrested and charged and long story short turned out to be a pretty well known architectural salvage dealer. The kicker was that when the police turned up to nick him, he asked if he could lock his van up before they booked him in as it was full of valuables and they obliged… turned out he was using his sign written van (also full of other stolen goods) which they then later used in court to tie him to the business and then the other thefts!",

After that, I started learning to build web applications and now I want to create a more affordable tool that can help small contractors better manage their businesses.\n\nThe app I'm working on will be an affordable, all-in-one platform with features like:\n\n* Project management\n* Accounts payable/receivable\n* Job costing and budgeting\n* Financial reporting\n* Equipment control\n* Document management (e.g., invoices, quotes)\n* Payroll\n* Multi-currency support (CAD/USD)\n* Bilingual support (English/French)\n\nWould you use something like this? What other features would you want to see in an app for small contractors?\n\nAdditionally, I’ve researched similar software and found that most competitors in this space charge between $49 to $500+ per month, depending on the feature set and number of users. My company was spending $300 per month and I never understood why it was so expensive but I also knew I needed it.  I want to offer a more affordable, all in one under $50 solution that still covers all the essentials. I'd love to get your feedback!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n ",

I'm on one side and my \"counterbalance\" coworker is on the other side of a frosty 20ft long ladder plank strapped to the forks of a gradeall boomed all the way out about 25-30ft in the air. We were doing 2x10 facia with 2x6 layered on top. 20ft long sticks we put up in place with angled bevel cuts everywhere. Fucking dumbest thing I ever did, and have seen.\n The snow was plowed below us, so you didn't even have that to break your fall onto the frozen ground. Good times!",

      "      I understand this, but my only experience on a scissor lift is outdoors and just the gentle rock of the wind made me crouch down in the basket, thinking somehow that was better. I couldn't imagine standing on the rungs maxed out, but indoors would be different.",
      "We've made pallet man lifts dozens of times. \n\nI was working in an empty warehouse installing pipe insulation on a water main standing on top of a 6ft ladder that was on top of the 3rd tier of mobile scaffolding. A dude walks in and asks me what I'm doing? Being a smart ass 20something I let him know I was adding padding to the pipe so that the pigeons wouldn't get calouses on their feet. He says good, keep working and walks out. A few minutes later some dude from the port authority rushes in and yells at me to get down, blah blah blah, that was the state OSHA inspector that had come in and you're in big trouble blah blah blah.. nothing came of it and I finished the job after getting a scissor lift on site.",

      "Omg. You would need to get the keys?  What a travesty!\n\n\nIt's always fine until it isn't.  Lots of people do dumb stuff every day and nothing  bad happens. Probably millions of people are moments away from accidents that almost, but didnt, happen.\n  The problem is, you don't really know when the luck runs out and somebody dies.\n\n\nIt's never a problem when nobody gets hurt.\n\n\nBut it sucks big time when an injury or death happens because of something you could have prevented. \n\n\nI'm not sure why you posted,  you know this.  And if you haven't experienced that,  great.  I hope you never do, and I look like an uptight prick.",
      "  Nah you’re right of course. It’s my way of coping. Truth is I’m a bit freaked out at the moment because I’m regularly pressured to do unsafe things, I’m “contract” work (read: fireable for no reason at any moment), and nobody else is hiring around here. So ya gotta vent and joke about it because what the hell else are ya gonna do, report it? lol",
      "Caught a guy on my crew riding up in our homemade plywood and 2x4 box (the box is for booming up tools and scrapping out) on the Lull to nail a wall behind the elevator shaft because our JLG didn't arrive on time. I just did a u-turn and acted like I didn't see it. I warned him not to do it. Next day the safety guy caught him walking 3rd floor exterior walls without fall protection and threw him off the job. Some guys never learn and don't give a fuck about safety.",
      "A major over site by the estimator and project manager had me ride the boom of our boom truck to cut off some pretty decent sized limbs from a tree. It was the day to set the pool. After hauling an oversized load through an older part of town where navigating the roads with a huge pool was never in their thoughts as they planned and built the town I didn’t want to do it again. With not enough room to offset the pool till after the limbs that were in the way had been trimmed our options were to turn around and take everything back to the shop and do it again in a week or mount the boom like a giant steel bull and ride that fucker till I was able to cut the limbs. Everything worked out, got the pool set and completed a day ahead of schedule and didn’t even get a ata boy from the boss man. Fuck businesses that don’t show appreciation for going the extra mile or even value their employees.",
      "Me and my crew are all Top Step Certified when need be, but I’ve been moving to a more “safety anal” mindset, I don’t want guys getting hurt",

      "this is why we can't have nice things",
      "That aint SOP?",
      "My dad would raise me and a worker on forks alone to the top of the ibeam to set the boards on when we built hay barns or freestall barns. Shit be swaying back and forth like crazy. Eventually after a couple close calls we finally built a custom cage that went on the forks. Much safer after that. But if we needed to get on the roof of the barns quickly we still ride on the forks. This was over twenty years ago.",
      "Just yesterday I got lifted like 30 feet in the air in the bucket of a mini-ex to tie off some temporary power to a tree that was running through the excavation we needed to make 🤷🏼‍♂️",
      "1 carpenter I worked for we built a garage with a lift on his property.\n\nHe put a ladder in the bucket of his front end loader.\n\nRaised him up, he climbed the ladder to finish the flashing.\n\nProblem really was that the hydraulics leaked. Had to keep the revs up on the tractor to keep the bucket from dropping.\n\nThem move him across the wall.\n\nMost redneck thing I've done, maybe",
      "When I was new we had a roof drain rip loose about 30 feet up and start blasting the room we were doing slab prep in.\n\nI took a ride in a hoe bucket to the ceiling after double checking that nobody was watching and fixed it, then at lunch our site super announced a special safety meeting. Dude gets us all together and says something like “I just wanted to make sure you all know not to do stupid shit like lift people in excavator buckets. I would definitely have to fire anyone if I saw them doing that”; then he showed us some safety videos.\n\nGood dude. Last bucket ride I’ve taken.",
      "Nice try, OSHA",
      "I used a 5k forklift to level a scissor lift on the ramp into the parking garage. In my defense, it was Saturday.",
      "Oh man we’re do I even start. I spent the last few weeks walking around a fifty foot high roof with a 14 pitch and no harness. We had some flimsy safety rail around a quarter of it but no were near the peaks. Rode up to said peaks on the forks with a piece of ply wood on it. Stood outside of basket on peaks . Residential high end custom framing is weird man. First month in",
      "Should have just gotten the scissor lift. Putting someone’s life in danger for laziness is horrible",
      "We had a guy who was light enough he could crawl on ceiling tile and not break them, funny when he’s 10’ up and is gonna fall on a flat ish surface , scary as shit when he was 35’ up over a stairwell",
      "  No body is that small to trust ceiling grid or tile",
      "    Yea hence why I told the owner since the foreman that hired him thought it was a good laugh.",
      "Nice try OSHA! I just refreshed my 30 by the way…",
      "I dropped something in a 15' test pit and rode the bucket down to grab it, not my finest moment",
      "I worked at a job where we had a man basket for the forklift, and there was a guy who was adamant about just standing on the forks to work on the 25 ft garage door instead of having me get the man basket first, I could barely watch while he was up there",
      "Try harder safety guy.",
      "We've all don't that",
      "We were taking a tree down a few years ago at a job, and my co worker convinced me to strap them up to my boom arm and cut some higher limbs like a crane. I've also convinced a guy to hoist me up in the front bucket of a backhoe so I could saw off limbs in a tree.",
      "I worked sideways on a ladder in order to save time. My knee is still recovering even though I did save time on that day.",
      "Safety harness slows me down.  I don’t wear it on pump jacks if I have a work bench.",
      "Dude we use the skid steer as a makeshift man lift damn near every day. I didn't know it was so bad 😂",
      "Regularly sheet my self on top of the roof and have to get the boys to send the jib up. You're good.",
      "I worked in a trench that was not cut at a proper 1:1 ratio",
      "  It is 1:1.5 ratio",
      "    OH&S code is different here in Alberta",
      "One time I leaned a pallet on a wall for a quick ladder, and one of the shitty boards broke, and I slide down balls first against a few boards. I thought I tore my sack, and now I don't do that anymore 🙃",
      "Before my foray into the world of construction I worked at Toys R Us stocking shelves. A lot of the product in the back room was stacked higher than any ladder could reach. Free climbing the racks and chucking boxes down from way high up or carrying them back down to the ladder. If it was fragile I would have to carry it down the ladder. Three points of contact right? 🤣. Osha who?",
      "I did this once to remove and replace a bird nest right abovr my smoking area at my first job when i was 18. It was likr 20 feet high. Still have a pic, looking back at it that was sketchy af lol",
      "Used a pallet and a skytrack to paint faicia at a factory. Good times.",
      "I had to get into a tight spot between a stairway going down to the floor below and a giant tank thing so I tie wired my 12 foot A frame to the handrail straight up and down and stood on top of that shit. Jk I would never do something unsafe at work.",
      "I built my own house with just my father helping me. I had an ancient International Harvester fork lift that was built out of a tractor and would lift up to 25 feet. I have to admit to spending a lot of time standing on a pallet on the forks with a sheet of CDX as my father hoisted me up to nail it off. Oh and it had no brakes.",
      "Way back when I was working on a farm instead of construction. The bosses boyfriend would use his boom lift to hunt off of. Well one morning we came in and found him stuck at the top...the battery had died. Of course he was a firefighter so he wouldn't let us call  the fire department to save him. He said hed never hear the end of them laughing at him. So we ended up taking the tractor with the forks, a pallet and a very sketchy straight ladder up in the air pretty high. Leaned it up against the boom just enough for him to reach. The entire rescue time I was debating where we'd hide the body in case it went terribly wrong. The whole rig was sketchy and super unsafe. He did make it down alive.",
      "There was a group of 3 people kicked off site for doing something similar. Difference being it was a telehandler and they were halfway up the building",

      "I watched a guy boom another buy up 48’ above grade to the peak of a rather large timber frame building on a fucked up pallet with a small generator and iron to cut out sip panels for sub fascia… I looked at the GC on site and said ‘ Is this guy serious?’ And he said ‘yea that’s pretty bad’ but then just let it happen…",
      "My boss has always told me he doesn’t care how fast it gets done as long as it gets done safely. Don’t hear that much in construction.\n\nI have also gotten a guy to lift me up on a pallet before though too",
      "I hope those racks were bolted down to the floor before you brought the forklift near them…",
      "I used to stack furnaces in a warehouse, we'd stack them four high, the third level is easy enough, lift the furnace with the forklift then slide it off the forks onto the stack, but the fourth level id stand on the forks with the furnace, get lifted up, shimmy it off the forks and onto the pile.. lather rinse repeat",
      "We use the forklift as our personal portable elevator",
      "Nothing like riding down a hill on the pallet on the front of a skid steer or telehandler",

      "OSHA: *heavy breathing*",
      "We have a work platform for the forklift which is fine but had an employee run a bunch of strings from the basket down to the cab so they could control it from up on the platform by themselves. That’s probably a no-no also.",

      "Had a general foreman get caught standing on the forks emptying one of those small steel dumpsters that still weigh 900lbs. The customer took a picture and sent it to our main office. \n\nI just saw him doing a service call pulling a single cable at a job I was at just last week.",
      "Man I’ve been stood on just the forks and had them all the way extended to get to a top shelf, you just gotta do what you gotta do 🤷‍♂️ OSHA rules are for people with no common sense"

That slab looks like it's starting to sag, so the areas in tension (bottom of slab) are spalling. From the areas that are exposed, the rebar is either now rusting or was already rusted. Rust causes the metal to expand so you're seeing more spalling where the rebar has the least amount of coverage. This exposes more rebar and compounds the rust problem. It becomes a vicious cycle. This is similar to what happened in the Surfside condo collapse in Florida.",
      "  I'm a structural engineer and you are absolutely right. The durability of the slab is effected and the rate of deterioration will accelerate. Remediation would involve propping the slab, chiseling out the damaged concrete, inspecting the reinforcement, possibly welding new reinforcement in places, and applying a repair mortar. Expensive, but that's the best case scenario.",
      "  Thanks!",
      "not the best looking slab. You could try to pin it from below if you have enough height. Make sure the gutters are working to keep the water at a minimum. Do some waterproofing\\\\tiling.\n\nIt'll collapse... eventually like everything. Best you can do is slow it down.",
      "  Thanks!",
      "Maybe, I’ve seen worse, not sure where you are located but don’t put any salt on top of that slab and try and limit exposure to moisture if at all possible, would be best to call and hire a structural engineer to do an assessment not ask the internet.",
      "  Thanks!",
      "That don't look to good from where I am skiing, Bubba.\n\nHow thick is the slab? How wide are the rebars?\n\nIt looks like most of the cracking is concentrated to the middle of the slab (area with the highest stress)\n\nI doubt it will collapse catastrophically,  more like cracks will grow bigger and large chunks may come off. There is not info info to go one here, a concrete contractor or a structural engineer will have to see this in person.\n\nI suggest inviting a few contractors over, pay them a few bucks for honest opinion. Look for older guys who have more experience in the business.",
      "  Thanks!",
      "Poke at it with a breaker bar. If it collapses, that's your answer. (Don't do this, you will die)",

    "Content": "I’m getting a complete gut down of my bathroom and remodeling it. I was going through the quote from my GC and found a few things I need suggestions on. \n\nBackground- I got a combined quote for 2 bathrooms and one kitchen. I’m okay with the smaller bathroom quotation but wondering about the main bathroom which is 4 piece. Please note- plumbing and draining and fitting in fixtures is extra. \n\nThis post is just to understand tiling installation cost. \n\nThe initial quote had waterproofing and 2 walls to be tiled. \nWaterproofing- $2200\n2 full walls floor to ceiling- $4800. \n\nSize of bathroom : 8 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet. \n\nI asked my GC to put tiles on the 2 more remaining walls which was suppose to be just dry wall and paint. I received a quote of $3000 for tiles. \nAlready paying for dry wall and framing separately. \n\nSo the total cost of tile installation - $2200+$4800+$3000= $10000. For all walls and floor, Floor to ceiling including Schuter waterproofing\nSize of the bathroom is 320 sq feet-4 walls and Floor. \n\nPlease advise if I’m missing out something here. Coz if I do the estimate per sq feet, including waterproofing which won’t be in the whole bathroom but wet areas, the cost is coming out to be $30 per square feet. \n\nThank you. ",

Are the tiles anything fancy, lots of cuts and corners etc that take more time? Anyway I’m too cheap and I can do basic tile but I would be over my head doing a full bathroom. Good luck",

    "Content": "hi ,  \nnew to the forum and would appreciate some feedback on water accumulation around the foundation of our walkout basement and possible mitigation for it.\n\nThe house is in Toronto, On. I have attached the side view drawing of the house and as you can see, there is a decent walkout basement area. The solid line is the current grading and underneath it is the basement area. the interlock in the walkout area was redone recently but after we dug a pit the house ( where the 2nd basement window is in the drawing), there is a large accumulation of water underneath the weeping tile (about 12 inch below the floor of basement). it was dug deeper (\\~ about 4 ft) and we  \nstill didn’t get to the bottom of the concrete foundation.\n\nWe pumped out the water in the pit to the level as shown in the 2nd picture and it doesn’t seem there is water filling up the hole (it has been 2 days).\n\nI suspect that the current weeping tile is connected to the sump pump in the basement inside the house. Since there is nowhere water can go below it, water just sit there since the soil underneath couldn’t absorb it.\n\nWe are little bit concern about the concrete foundation being submerged in water, causing damage. The house is about 15 years old. One contractor suggested that we install a sump pump where the hole/water is and pump out extra water as required. I am concerned about the related maintenance of the pump since we have to put a cover back and worry about the freezing winter here.\n\nDo I need to worry about water at the frost wall below the weeping tile since there is no living space behind it? Will the freeze damage the concrete?  \nwill frost heave take place since the backfill is mainly gravel stone?\n\nreally appreciate your feedback!",

I get it’s more expensive than you expect ( even if in my construction trained brain, why would you not budget for electrical), but have the courtesy to tell me no.

      "I am an electrician who went through a five year union apprenticeship (started at 46) and then an additional five years working for others. This is fine and many journey(wo)men work for others their entire career.  I however knew the really good money was in working for myself. I studied for a few months, took the electrical contractors test, passed and formed my own company. This is the best thing I ever did.\n\nI work mainly solo doing residential and light commercial service jobs. Occasional, I hire in a crew for bigger jobs that will last a few weeks or more. (I hire through the union so I can have a crew at the job the next day and I can also layoff instantly when the workers are no longer needed.) Here are the advantages of being a contractor:\n\n* While sometimes big companies have no work and you can't find a job as an employee, there are always lots of small jobs a solo practitioner can find. Many times I was booked out two weeks.\n* You only have to accept the jobs you want to work on.\n* You can sub out the portions of the job you don't want to work on. I usually subbed out trenching. \n* You charge a lot of money per hour and keep most of it.\n* You can work as many or as few hours as you wish.\n* You can sleep late. The earliest I ever started a job was 9am. Half day jobs I started at noon or 1pm with the morning off.\n* You can hire people to work for you (although employees are the biggest hassle of being in business). I have on occasion hired a foreman to run the crew so I didn't have to. I usually stopped at the job daily in the afternoon to make sure it's running smoothly.\n* You can schedule around vacations and doctor's appointments. You don't have to beg anybody not to lay you off because you are taking time off.\n* There are no supervisors to yell at you or lay you off.\n\nI believe you will find plumbers will have very similar experiences to electricians.",

      "Union roofer here, only bout 3 years in but feel like I finally found a calling. Sometimes you gotta work long hours, especially during peak construction season, but the work/life balance is a lot better than folks outside the trades realize.\n\nThere's also plenty of opportunities for advancement. Know plenty of folks who started in the field and moved into estimating, project management, teaching, manufacturer rep, even ownership in some cases. You don't gotta be in the field your entire career if you develop your skills.",
      "  can’t wait to get started",
      "It has a lot more to do with what you do with your money, than the money you make.  The money will come in time, don’t be afraid to seek the better paying companies as you gain experience.  Get experience doing weird shit that makes you valuable.\n\nBut, if you want to be wealthy, don’t consult us, consult a fiduciary (different than a stock broker).  A fiduciary is obligated to make investment advice with your best interest in mind.  Stock brokers are not obligated to do this.  Start with a fiduciary, understand what types of investment are out there, and if you still have money to burn, go to a stock broker and get aggressive with a small amount of money.  You need a foundation to build wealth.  \n\nIf you treat the trades good, they will treat you good.  So go be the best you can be, get paid for it, and use your money wisely.  \n\n******choose your life partner wisely.  A good plan is ruined by someone with taste above their means.",

      "Nothing under thousands of dollars will do you any good, especially with three windows. Your best bet will be a white noise machine. But you won't like that answer.\n\nYou could stagger your wall framing to de-couple the exterior wall from your interior wall and then re-insulate. . But then that leaves the windows. So you could upgrade to triple pane, for not a lot of sound isolation gains. All in all it would be about $10k. A white noise machine is $40.",
      "  The big thing I gleaned from my Acoustics class is that to stop sounds from coming in to where you're at is near impossible.  The best thing you can do is mitigate the sound being made, otherwise you're going to be spending thousands of dollars to be disappointed. \n\nA one inch hole is basically enough to cancel all the soundproofing with the high frequencies - low is going to go right through. \n\nWhite noise machine is the best answer in questions like these, unfortunately.",

Cut them out like an inch or two bigger than the window itself so they stay nice and snug and block all the noise and light",

      "          Why don't you make a Youtube video of your solution? I am sure the lady will comply with it if you do not show her details, just the window and the foam topper. It will help countless people who search for a practical solution to noise.",

If the wall is block, the space between the block and the drywall is likely 3/4 of an inch and probably not insulated but could be. If it's not insulated, 3/4\" of spray foam won't help much and will be difficult to install.\n\nYour best bet would be to glue 2-4\" thick styrofoam panels to the wall, then glue sheetrock over the foam. An electrician can easily extend any outlets or switches flush to the new surface. A finish carpenter can install new trim around the windows.\n\nI would then install heavy, sound reducing drapes on all the windows.",
      "  The exterior is brick but the interior wall is standard 2x4 with drywall",
      "    Since there is probably fiberglass insulation inside the wall, poking some holes to install spray foam won't work well. You can make a small hole in the wall to verify the insulation type.\n\nYou can remove the drywall and existing insulation, spray foam the wall, and reinstall drywall. You could also use styrofoam panels which is likely cheaper on such a small project. If you use panels, you can install it over existing fiberglass. Just see how much the fiberglass compresses and buy the proper thickness foam panel to take up the remaining space. \n\nFor maximum sound reduction, do what I suggested in the previous reply or after filling each bay with insulation, lay a 1/2\" foam panel over the entire wall and then drywall over that. The 1/2\" of  foam separating the studs from the drywall will significantly reduce mechanically transmitted noise.",

There's a reason professional recording studios don’t have windows to the outside. But go ahead, do what you want. It's like asking how to stop a boat from leaking while ignoring the obvious solution of fixing the hole.",
      "      Yes. The only solution is to have an extra window pane made to fit interior for the existing window. \n\nSpacing has to be 1” between the glass for optimum noise reduction. It will also insulate against heat and cold. \n\nSprayInsulating the already insulated walls, will only make it worse. \n\nIf its not enough with the extra pane. Then look at knauff insulated drywall system. \n\nBecause then its not noise perse.But the vibrations from the engines that is bothering you.",

      "        i dont understand, do you disagree with anything I said in specific?\n\nall im saying is you cant no notice walk out of a job and also expect your boss to have a positive reference ready for you. \n\nimagine you got fired and 2 days later your old boss calls and asks for your trade friend’s contact who works at another company, hes looking to poach him. are you gonna tell him to fuck off or give him the contact info?\n\nyou tell him to fuck off\n\nim not saying anything about whos right or whos wrong, im saying you have double standards",
      "          Yes. I disagree with you saying I have double standards. I would hold no ill will towards someone for a fair firing. Layoffs happen in construction and you get a job with another company. \n\n\nWhy not? If someone was a great worker. But found better opportunities elsewhere. It's reasonable to go after that. It didnt change your work. Also theres laws set up in some states where references basically means saying they worked there. \n\n\nI dont imagine a scenario where that would happen. But id say no. Not cause I hold a grudge. But because im not a recruiter. Also a normal person would ask if the other person wanted their # given out before giving it out.",

      "                  There's no difference between a coworker, a subcontractor, and an employee because I'll give someone a good reference if they're a good worker. Regardless of notice.\n\n\n\n\nJesus you're stupid huh",

      "    That got dark, quick!",
      "Wow, maybe it's the US-centricness of this sub, but is there not an entire massive amount of workplace regulation that govern this?\n\nIn my country they must prove cause to fire you without any sort of severance, unless you're in the initial 3 month probationary period. As the years build up, so does the severance pay due at termination of employment. I think the bare minimum after a few years is 5 days. Most industries it's weeks. Some senior employees (even in construction) are given several months of pay, if you work for a reputable employer. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you're laid off or fired. It's part of the cost of firing you.",
      "  No definitely not a bunch of regulation here. In my US state, we’re “fire at will” which means they can fire you on the spot for whatever reason. However, if you think it’s unfair or discriminatory, you can file a grievance with the labor board. At least, this is what I’ve always been told, haven’t looked at the actual laws in writing.",
      "You're thinking too small.",
      "  How so?",
      "    European countries you get several months of severance and ample warning. There's plenty of money if you don't get a new truck every year. I think it would be a good policy to institute nation wide across all industries to keep all employers honest. To much fuckery from the higher ups across all industries, not just construction. Might solve the American greed problem.",

      "Edit: IDK how I ended up in this sub. I'm in an ass in chair job.\n\nEvery company I've ever worked for has given more than 2 weeks to laid off employees. Usually 2-3 months, sometimes more.\n\nImagine you're in the same industry and don't, who's going to want to work for you or stay instead of looking elsewhere if you don't meet those expectations?\n\nI always give 2 weeks or more. One I contracted for 3 months handing off stuff, but pretty minimal hours. Reputation matters.",
      "Depends on what you did to get “fired”\n\nIf it’s a layoff that has nothing to do with performance I think payment should be made out of respect for the employee.\n\nIf you were a complete idiot beyond “everybody makes mistakes” then no. Let’s say you’re toxic to work with or your quality of work is always bad even after multiple lessons and warnings. I feel your employer should not have to pay for 2 weeks after firing. \n\nGetting fired means you fucked something up real bad. And chances are it isn’t the first time.",
      "If you give two weeks notice, and they fire you for those two weeks, you deserve 2 weeks unemployment payments.  For starters.",
      "Don't worry about them, they won't fire you and give you two weeks notice so don't give them two weeks notice.",
      "Why would you get rewarded for sucking? If the boss can't keep you busy you can get all the unemployment your owed, but why should you get anything for being bad enough at your job to lose it.",

      "If you are switching jobs because of opportunity,  not bitterness,  then mutual respect dictates notice.  It's courteous,  and if there is no ill will then why not? If the place you are leaving is shitty, then it's deuces and out.",
      "My company fired an employee and as they walked him out the front door, his replacement was brought in through the back door and given his office. \n\nI bet the chair was still warm.",
      "  Damn",

      "I like to give my employers a “2day” notice when I’m leaving.. as in TODAY, I’m leaving TODAY",
      "Never give 2 weeks notice. A company will never give you two weeks. Oftentimes they will fire you on the spot.",
      "No but two weeks heads up I’m gonna be fired.",
      "Do you want a reference or to ever have an option to come work there again?  Then yes I’d give 2 weeks.  Do you hate them and never want to come back?  Fuck it give the 2 day notice, I’m quitting 2day",
      "That’s why it’s called getting two checked. Two weeks pay upon lay off.",
      "  Never heard that term before",
      "Some jobs just get ✌️\n\nIf you want to leave on good terms give notice",
      "In the two weeks after you give, you're (theoretically) working so you get paid for those weeks. If you get fired, why should they pay you to do two weeks of no work?",
      "  What if they fire you right after you give your two week notice?",
      "    Then you neither work nor get paid for those two weeks. That situation actually happens a lot. There are a number of employers who will terminate your employment as soon as you give notice. It can be a liability having a disgruntled employee who doesn't have to face consequences for what he does in the next two weeks having access to company property.",
      "You desperately need workers' rights.\n\nI'd be like \"by the way, tomorrow I work somewhere else\" if the contract says that they can fire me anytime.",
      "Give em the ol to day notice- I’m out this bitch to-day. \n\nI have always enjoyed dragging up. I’d drag up just to get a vacation. My boss now is a good one so I’ve been with him almost six years. If I need a vacation or just a day I just take one and he don’t give me any shit.",

      "  Oh yeah. This glue is 10 years old and on the concrete like a mother. \n\nI'm guessing they did that when running the wire cause the drop channels are aluminum and don't have the rubber/vinyl edge guard to prevent that kinda wire striping.\n\nWe're putting LVP. Wanted to give them enough room to trowel the glue and set the planks. Should be fun.",
      "    Yea that’s fair. Generous of you. \n\nNo way a panel lift cuts up wire like that. I’ve seen some damage from a smash before but you would have to be dragging the wire over the edge and you would see blue and shit on the edge of the cubical etc. not on you. \n\nI did this for 8ish years.  I’ve seen it all, that old green 3M glue from the 70s is the worst even a panther struggles. Sharpen the blade every 15 mins.  Work your ass off for 4 hours, then sit around while the carpet guys crawl around the room and the lead is doing the lift. Easy nights.",
      "      I am learning a lot bout commercial carpet in this project. The floor guys are using a U-Blade to cut and lift the carpet. My floor scrapper is too light, only 150lbs, so they gotta use their weight to push it down into the carpet. \n\nTrying to rent a bigger heavier one, but none are available at the moment till Thursday. The floor buffer with the scraping attachment is doing great removing the glue.",
      "        Yea keep those square bits sharp and you will have an easy time, watch the screw/nail heads, I always used a fat sharpie to circle them before they go over to them or hand scrape a little around it. Saves on the bits and they aren’t cheap. \n\nIf the glue it gets too wet, all purpose flour is your friend, don’t have to go nuts with it, and it’s not as dirty as you would think. \n\nWe just called them “panthers” it may have been the brand. Heavy sob with weight plates. Vibrates back and forth to cut and scrape the carpet. \n\nUse a piece of carpet folded and taped to the top of the handle so you can put your chest into the machine and not hurt and get your legs going, lift a little bit by pushing forward, to pitch the unit, and a SHARP blade should let you keep going. May have to take half bites or shorter pulls.  Try going the other direction as well with the grain(the glue, carpet backing) or against it. \n\nLittle hack/tip, take a 4 wheeled dolly and tip it so it’s on the side then lay the machine on dolly so you kinda replace the back wheels of the carpet machine with the 2 on the dolly, that lift is enough pitch to get a good angle to scrape. It takes a min to get used too, but I’ve used that trick many times before. \n\n\nOther wise. You’ll have to cut narrow strips and hand pull.",

    "Content": "My issue with this subject is based on many facets.  First, I have been in the Low Voltage profession for almost 35 years.  I have worked on everything from fire/security alarms, intercom, door access, surveillance systems, panic systems, signaling systems, phone tech, cable tech, computers and networking, VOIP systems almost too many to mention in both service and installation.  I was a service manager for 12 years in my last job back in Texas and covered most counties in the entire state.  That being said, I moved to California (where my wife is from).  Found out I needed a \"blue card\" to work at most jobs here.  We didn't have an equivalent back in Texas.  Licenses were given by the state of Texas on an ID card for low voltage.  Not a union state either.  Started working for a company here and got the SSN report for my employment history and applied to take the test for Fire/Life/Safety.  They denied me saying the company back in Texas did not hold a C10 License and my years of experience didn't count. California also put into effect that even if you have a blue card and didn't do an apprenticeship, you now have to go to apprentice school any way.  So the current situation is I am employed by a company without a blue card, taking an apprentice program, not being accompanied by a journeyman required by the apprentice program, being paid the base pay as a journeyman so as to do a run around of the journeyman/apprentice requirement, had my prevailing wage taken away and still being sent out by myself doing journeyman level work and even having to teach a few of their blue card holding journeyman how to do their jobs and wondering..... What the heck is going on here in California?....  Any comments or advice to help me get past any of these issues would be much appreciated.",

You’d learn how to work with metal, weather proofing, composite trim, wood trim, diff’t fasteners, insulating, caulking, mitre cuts, patio door installs, etc. \n\nYou might start by being a bit of a laborer but in time you’d have your hands of all aspects of that type of work because crews are small. \n\nHigher end trim work, like railings, crown molding, building built in cabinets, learning how to scribe baseboard are other finish carpentry skills all add up to being well rounded. There are companies out there willing to take a green guy on and show them the ropes if they’re motivated and diligent.

      "Everyone saying slide drywall behind the flange is wrong. Standard practice for framers to frame a 5’-1/4” opening for a 5’ tub, leaving roughly an 8th on both sides. The gap should close once the flange is fastened to the studs. The drywall or cement board stops at the flange. The tiler will thank you. They don’t want to butt up to round inside corners, plus its not a bad idea to give a little room for the flange to flex a little between studs",
      "  Thanks, you hear so many different versions of what it should be",
      "  you are 100% correct!",
      "  This guy is one of the few correct comments on here.",
      "  This is how we do it too. Waterproof board terminates on the flange of tub. Never had any issues.",
      "    And then continue the tile down overlapping the flange?\n\nDo you use silicone to fill the gap between tile and the tub or siliconized grout?",
      "      Yes, the tile should sit directly on the “deck” of the tub. And that joint, as well as any 90° joint, gets 100% silicone, “color matched” to grout color (manufacturers use that term loosely though, some silicones are dead on match, some are horrific and I’ve had to scrape out silicone on jobs before, no fun).",
      "        Do you leave a small gap where the tile meets the surface of the tub, to be siliconed later? Or do you butt the edge of the tile right up against the tub?",
      "          That’s a good question, it kind of depends on the tub. Sometimes I just start the tile right on the tub, other times I’ll use some really small spacers to get everything just right across that first row. Other times I’ll leave the first course of tile out completely, screw a ledger in the wall where it would go, and start from the second course up. Once that’s all set up, I’ll come back and put that first course in. \n\nThe determining factor is the tub. Is it dead flat or is there a little belly in the middle of it? Does the rail of the tub curve up a little, to promote drainage to the basin? If it’s dead dead flat you can just tile right on the tub and keep on going. Often times we’ll need to make some adjustments in the first course for imperfections in the tub. Which will all disappear once it’s siliconed.",

      "  No. plumber had nothing to do with it. The framer left too large a space. SOP is framing tight to the tub.",

      "There have not been a lot of changes. Since we are reaching the point of diminishing returns. The next big change will be to require continuous insulation but many builders are fighting that change since it will add considerably cost and complexity to most projects. So a lot of states are delaying adding that to the code. Some states are requiring it now. But not many.",
      "  so i should expect to see/feel slim to 0 improvement?",
      "    Correct. Unless you work with a custom builder that does high end energy efficient homes. At this point buildings are really efficient. To make them more takes a payoff period of 10 or more years. But comfort can be approved a lot more. Exterior insulation and triple plane window will make a huge difference.",
      "    I'm one of those energy efficient builders.  Mostly contractors can be lazy and greedy.  The basic metric is how much can I charge.  The answer is down to how much can you afford.  This isn't related to how much it costs or how long the payback is for something like efficiency.  If you will pay 100,000 because thats all you can afford.  What benefit does a salesman have to offer you additional value.  None.  And more builders are sales people than competent trades people.  \n\nIn my jurisdiction in zone 5 Colorado I can nearly double the code insulation value and show less than a 3 year payback.  Windows on the other hand can be 10-40 years on great windows.  We already are required to do continuous insulation.  \n\nThe reality is most builders can't actually define R value and how it relates to energy flow. Much less calculate how much energy is saved vs a simple loan amortization.  Builders fall into 2 basic camps those that are carpenters and know how to build a strong house that won't fall down, and those that have no idea what makes a house stand up but know how to sell.  Neither normally spend much time dealing with energy efficiency.  The best we have to offer is HERs raters which is a greenwashing marketing scam that takes a week to learn.  The guys that can make your building stand up spend a few years learning. The guys that will make your home efficient spend a few days."

      "Not bad for a first attempt.\n\nAvoid the cross joints, and you have a few vertical runs, try not to have the quoines ( corner stones) lengthways up like that, not structurally correct.\n\nYour trowel work looks clean though, so keep at it my dude.",
      "It’s cleanly laid but you’ve stacked corner stones way too high, as seen in pics 2, 4, and 5. Corner stones need to alternate direction into the wall because they’re what give the column structure. Personally that’s something I’d redo. [Here’s](http://www.selectstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/bobby-watt-snecked-stonemasonry.pdf) an article about working with ashlar stone. \n\nAnother major thing is not laying the long side of a stone vertically, because structurally and aesthetically it does nothing. They mention blocked joints in the article, where 2 stones are on either side of a joint. This is probably the hardest rule to follow when you’re working on a narrow space, and I’ve seen tons historic or high quality work break this rule. However you absolutely want to avoid stacking 3+ stones against each other in a vertical joint. \n\nThink about trying to get the stone to interlock as much as possible, with lots horizontal overlap and short vertical joints, because the strength comes from its weight, and friction. Don’t rely on mortar and wall ties to act as glue. \n\n[Here’s](https://www.instagram.com/reidstonemasonry?igsh=OW1zZnh1MGVtNGVt) another guy who does lots of nice column work",
      "  Thanks for all the tips and advice!  I'll probably just redo the one that's halfway built, the customer is very pleased with the other one and it's already done.  I'll definitely take all of this into affect for further building and it's also the reason I was overthinking my work.",
      "    Yea start on the corners first and fill in. The corner stones should be relatively large with the smaller stuff in the middle. Normally larger stones get used in the bottom because there’s where they’re needed since they’re supporting the most weight. In reference to the article biggest stones like the 2 in the first pic are your risers. The longer medium height stones are your levelers, and the small blocky ones are your snecks. This looks like manufactures stone so it should be fairly easy to keep the joints from being taller than the risers without making cuts. Good luck and take your time",
      "  I agree 100%, great stuff. I believe this is lafitt stone correct? There's only 3 sizes i believe, so really should keep your pattern fairly simple, especially for a column like that.",
      "Lots of good constructive criticism/support here. What I’ll add is to think of the stones like Lego. You want to over lap your joints, no long vertical lines or cross joints. Best to start at the corners and finish into the middle. Try to alternate your corners as you go vertical. \n\nLooks really clean though.",
      "Looks good.",
      "Maybe it's just the angle of the photos, but do you have a plumb stick?",
      "My question (even though this is CMU wrap) - was the CMU set on a wider concrete footing, providing the equivalent of a brick ledge to begin your lay?\n\nIf not, and it was simply excavated 12” +/- into the sub grade, your veneer work will crack out over time from soil movement.  Even though they are both masonry products they will incur varying rates of differential movement.   Depending on the region, frost line, and annual precipitation, it could happen in a little as a year’s time if your stone work is sitting in dirt and relying solely on the embedded brick ties."

      "  Imagine bro wasn’t wearing a hard hat",
      "    That definitely helped, but the high vis vest saved his life",
      "      😂😂😂. Fuck dude, I’m going to save this video to show the next safety puke that bitches at me for not wearing high vis. I agree with being safe but safety guys take it in the ass from there wife and fucking love it.",
      "    Eh, hard hats are only meant to take vertical impacts.  Laterals can and will ring your noggin, as the strapping flexes over.",
      "      Absolutely wrong. That was so easily a cracked skull without a hard hat it's not even funny",
      "        \nHard hats are designed to protect against different types of impacts, including vertical and sideways impacts:\nType 1 hard hats\nDesigned to protect against vertical impacts, primarily from objects falling from above.\nType 2 hard hats\nDesigned to protect against both vertical and lateral impacts, including blows from the side, front, and back. \n\nFor additional information:\nhttps://www.coopersafety.com/hard-hat-class-standards\n\nYou’ll note the type 2s are foam lined (much like a bicycle helmet.  Now, if the hard hat that fellow is wearing is a type 2, (which I will give, looking closer, his hardhat does look like a higher coverage model), then sure, it absolutely helped.  Type 1s though, which are what I typically see in the field, do jack-shit from the side.  \n\nI was knocked unconscious from a lateral hit while wearing a type 1.  Forehead sgot split open, and I suffered whiplash and a concussion. Type 1s are ASS, and I hate seeing the myth of “should’ve worn your hard hat” applied to lateral impacts. \n\nThat said, I think I’ll stand corrected here.  The hard hat looks like it was secured in place, so likely a type 2.  Which would have definitely helped.",
      "          Do you really think this guy would've been no worse for wear if that happened to him with a bare head? It may not be designed for it but the hard hat definitely helped this time.",
      "          As a mechanical engineer, I can confidently say that what something is designed for means absolutely nothing in the real world, when compared to results from use in practice. That's the intent of my comment -- the injury would have been a greater magnitude had he not worn the hard hat, design intent aside",
      "      Shut up nerd, no one asked the safety “officer” to chime in",
      "    I got clocked by a backhoe bucket once. I wasn’t wearing a hard hat and it knocked me flat but no concussion or anything.",
      "      \nThis reminds me of the time I rear-ended a dude in a new VW bug. No damage at all to his car. Mine was totaled. He sued my insurance company, claiming neck and back pain and *loss of sexual desires.*  \n\nHe got the limit of my PIP.  I found out that they can't test for that stuff, and learned a lesson for the future if anyone ever rear-ends me.\n\nEDIT: I replied to the wrong comment.",
      "    He would have fuckin exploded",
      "  Add some neck pain. Concussions can be more easily proven/disproven.\n\nEdit: I have come to learn that dilated pupils are not always present with a concussion.",
      "    No they can't. They can't scan you or anything to see if you have a concussion. They ask you about your symptoms and if you say you have enough symptoms  you're diagnosed with a concussion. Just learn the symptoms before your appointment and fail the balance test during the appointment.\n\n\nEdit to add: neck pain is a symptom they ask about, so you're right about that. But faking a concussion is easy.",
      "      I was thinking, \"There's got to be some test,\" but according to the University of Michigan, there's not. Which means I was about to spread misinformation about the eye dilation thing. \n\nI figured \"well when your eyes are normal, they'll know youre not concussed\" but that's necessarily true.\n\nSo yeah, everything I thought about faking a concussion being hard is wrong.",
      "        Yeah as a former EMT if I show up to a scene and the patient took a blow to the head and now their pupils are dilated they are going code 1 to the nearest trauma center. They might have a subdural hematoma or neurological damage. Even if you suspect a mild concussion always get checked out. Nowadays if the impact was significant they'll often do imaging to ensure your brain isn't bleeding, which might be where you got the idea about tests for concussion.",
      "    If pupils have an uneven response to light it can indicate a concussion. It's why doctors shine a light in your eyes one at a time and see if the other pupil reacts.\n\n  \nSource: was an EMT 5 years ago and vaguely remember a few things.",

He was trying to articulate from the boom pin rather than the turret so he should have been swinging, or swung over already anyway to line up his boom with his work zone. \n\nWhat if he would have killed that guy?

      "      100% percent chance it gets asked why he was standing there when its investigated. Yes big machines can kill you easily. Thats why you dont stand that close. A simple mistake by the operator can end your life if you are not careful, so why not be careful?",
      "        There's enough fault here for both of them.",
      "          Yeah, the operator has a responsibility to see who’s in the swing zone as well and not operate. He may not get fired but would probably be suspended. At the end of the day if nobody was hurt they’ll both keep hush hush to avoid getting trouble.",

It's like if you hurt somebody while driving and you weren't at fault. You still have to live with the fact that you hurt somebody. I don't think anybody with the proper training and knowledge would stand there on purpose. So he either made a mistake, was un trained, or lacked knowledge. None of them condemn him for always being at fault or being called stupid if he gets injured.\n\nYou can take it a step further and make some rude assumptions and say neither of these dudes are trained, neither of them are knowledgeable, and in these situations they often know each other personally. So why not look out for your friend? It's not always about OSHA or workplace safety. Sometimes it's just about common sense and human decency.",
      "      The mini controls aren't great at the best of times.  From the ones I've operated it's always shaky and normally it's not a dedicated operator and just a labourer in it.  Never trust even the best operator in any machine.",

He wasn’t in his blind spot, his ass is just too fat to run the mini well, or he can’t see.\n\nYeah they are fast and jerky, it’s on me as the operator to be aware of that, and if I want the laborer to get back, I’ll tell him.  He was in a good spot here, the operator just sucked.  He was helping spot him.",

      "            In the real world, as a hoe operator I regularly have guys within arms reach of my bucket while actively working. Never hit anyone in 10+ years of operating. A guy pulls that on any job site around here (in Alberta) he’d get pulled out of the hoe and fired.",

      "                    If you’re telling me you never have a guy in the swing zone of an excavator, you’re either lying, or are the slowest company around. You expect guys to climb out of a hole every time I swing? That’s not how it works. How do you pull grade? Have the excavator back up 30’ every time the guy on the stick needs to take a shot? Get real.",
      "                      Ah so we've moved from \"regularly\" to \"never\"\n\nAll I'm saying is I wouldn't make a habit out of it. That's called complacency lmao",

      "      Its been so long since I've used one of those (clearly the guy in the vid as well), is articulating the boom just a button on these? Based on how jerky it is I'm assuming so.\n\nYeah I mean its better to at least stand at the back of the bucket when doing this anyway I guess (or at least not in the one spot you can get crushed between the bucket and fence). But this is just a VERY dumb move for an operator to make.\n\nAlso the fuck is he doing with his bucket so high anyway.\n\nAlso its crazy how many people think you won't have people in the swing radius. Federal utility companies do, unions do, government workers do. \n\nRoadwork? Every open traffic lane is within that large excavators swing radius. If they turn? The counterweight swings into an open lane of traffic.\n\nIts absolutely better to stand at least behind the bucket instead of right beside the bucket, but not being in the swing radius at all isn't realistic.",
      "        They're not a button they're a little foot pedal that actuates left and right in orientation with the boom. The pedal works off of a little pendulum and has two separate linear actuators that only have like 1/2\"-1\" of total throw so there's really no touch. Then like people have mentioned, they get dirty between the foot pedal and the actuator so it becomes really mushy and you're basically smashing through the caked mud until the pedal activates the actuator, at which point you're putting so much pressure on the thing that there's no way you can slow the boom down before it swings. They also have a pin that holds the pedal in place and a lot of times those get rusted or bent because nobody gives a shit and then they never work right again. \n\nYep. People in these comments have no valuable perspective of the way that like 80% of the work gets done. I've been on big jobs or jobs with big companies where everything was done right most of the time. But for the vast majority of the work completed with these types of machines, you can't always be out of the way. I'm not saying it's right, I'm just saying it's true. I'm also not saying that the spotter here was right or in the right place. I'm saying that there's two people on this job and both of them should be looking out for the other one.",
      "      Have you ever used some of these little rental ones like that? Sometimes you're not maintained 100% perfect. It could have been a stuck actuator and that's what caused it to jerk like that that's the reason why you don't stand too close to him. If you worked in the field you'd probably know this.",
      "        You're in a cab-less machine with nothing going on around you while your spotter is trying to show you where to go, there's no reason to swing towards him with your boom and teeth all the way extended. When the pedals get stuck, what you do if you can't clean it is either heel-toe sideways across the pedal, or put one foot on either side, and swing your cab out of the way of anybody before you function it. I probably have around 2,000 hours on this exact model of piece of shit little yanmar/komatsu because I got my start 15 years ago doing fiber jobs in people's backyards, and this machine has the tracks that run in and out from 36-42\". There are a few valid excuses that something like this could happen but the stupid shit you just said isn't one of them.",
      "          So you just admitted my whole point there are things that would cause that to do what it did but yet you want to complain that I'm not entirely accurate on my description of a problem that could possibly happen.",
      "    No way it was the spotter fault... We work close to excavator all day long from mini ex to 50 tons machine. He wasnt in a blind spot at all and if the operator wasnt confortable with a labourer close to him he have to tell him. How you are laying underground pipes with nobody in the trench ?\n\nIf it was a high pressure gas or water line next to him would it have been the pipe's fault for getting hit.\n\nThis operator clearly doesnt know what he is doing, bucket and stick fully extended while moving, command fault... Get him out of there before he kill someone.",
      "      Spotter is boss and just refused to listen. \"I tell you what to do, stand there, extend the arm, don't complain about the controls! Now move the arm!!! … Hey, it's your responsibility to not extend the arms and to not use the controls when I'm in the way!!!!!!\"",
      "      The spotter should never have been that close to the machine and it isn't the operator's job to tell people to stay away from the machine.  Laborers should NEVER be within the operating area of heavy machinery.",
      "        Ok have you ever been on an excavation site. Sanitary, sewer and water line ? Labourer doing fine grade with a laser or raking top soil or aggregate ? French drain ? Retaining walls ? The only time for me where it's a no no for a labourer to be around an excavator is when it load trucks or during mass excavation.",
      "    Dude, I'm all about safety, but come on. That's straight up operator carelessness. If the guy was standing behind the excavator and operator swung around 180 deg and hit him, would it still be the laborers fault?",
      "      I don't trust anyone, even myself. I'd wait to see hands off the controls before I'd go in, and I'd have my hands off them if it's someone else going in.  Even still operator is ultimately responsible, but lessons learned on both sides.",
      "      What country do you live in where a laborer is allowed to stand behind an operating excavator?  That's a terrible idea, the operator couldn't see you at all and could very easily kill you.  Assuming people on your job site have any safety training at all, you should at MINIMUM be double the operating distance of a piece of heavy machinery like that.",
      "        Not sure if you're in construction, but it is very common for a laborer to be standing in a safe vicinity of a machine digging. Where the guy wasn't standing wasn't ideal, but if the operator is digging, the laborer could reasonably be standing there and not expect to get slapped in the face with a bucket.",

That stupid Deere foot pedal is such crap, and should absolutely be a Bobcat style thumb switch, but that's just my correct opinion.",

It's a safety issue at that point and should be taken out of service. It takes 5 extra minutes to grab a broom and clean the floor.",
      "    It's definitely not a safety issue, seeing as it doesn't impact anything other than machine speed. Someone being right next to the arm while an inexperienced (or even experienced) operator is in the machine is the safety issue here.\n\nEdit: machines bounce, move, shudder, and skip. You should absolutely, 100%, never be so close to any part of a machine that an unexpected bounce could hit you. The machine 100% isn't what's unsafe in the video, it's the morons in and around it.",

      "    These super mini excavators have especially bad controls from the factory for some reason. Our 418 (Same as E10) had a bad foot pedal that has only got worse with age, and is very jerky because you basically need your whole foot to depress it either way and it's hard to finesse that.",
      "  Yeah, he did use the foot pedal.  Like he was playing CoD.  Easy peasy works better.  I do agree some are crazy touchy, but he still ain’t very good on it.\n\nAnd yes, if you can’t trust the operator, be out of his swing path.",

      "    probably just cheaper plumbing the hydraulic lines to a pedal in the floor than a rocker switch in the joystick.\n\n\n\n\ni drive a truck for an equipment rental company and operate the smallest and largest excavators. it's always best to have all the controls be easily finessed by a stick or rocker switch.",
      "      You move the smallest and largest machines on and off the truck, you don’t operate.",
      "    Foot pedals are a carry over from the old CASE / FORD backhoe controls.\nBefore rocker switches and buttons when it was hydraulic pilots you could do more functions at the same time by using foot pedals to swing the boom left and right.",
      "  Yea you gotta counter rotate while you boom over. It helps counter act the jumpyness",
      "  Yep our 3, 5 and 8 tonne machines are mostly rickety old Kubotas, you press that pedal they swing exactly the same as this, you gotta be so careful around buildings and people shouldn’t be stood that close to the machine!",
      "Operator has NO IDEA what he’s doing. He’s testing functions to see what they do. Also, 100% dude on the ground should not have been in the swing area. Both men in this situation are meat heads. Incident reports all around, OR if old school site? Someone is getting a beating",

      "To be honest with yall.\n\nI'm a Groundworks Supervisor. I see this happen onsite and we have a major investigation. \n\nIdeally, the banks man should not be that close to an operating machine. \n\nFirstly because of exactly what happened. \nSecondly because it looks like the scope of works is to remove the screed or the entire slab, upon which the banks man is stood. Which would lead to the banksman falling if his footing is compromised. \n\nIn the UK we undergo Health and Safety Training as par for the course. The first thing were taught is that within all reasonable circumstances, WE are responsible for our own health. And WE are responsible as a group for everyone working in our vacinity. Employers try to route out all unsafe practices and make us sign all sorts of H+E assessments and CODE OF conduct contracts etc to enforce us to work in a safe manner. \n\nI think both parties are at fault. \n\nAs a topman for a deep drainage gang, I've been in dangerous contact with excavators. I've been down trenches with a 21t Hitachi digging in front of me and sand blowback through drainage holes in the excavator bucket has nearly blinded me. I've seen contract managers approach diggers from the rear and get knocked over by the counterweight. \n\nI've also operated diggers. And woah lads, little diggers are so fucking jerky. If tipped a half tonne because the slew didn't stop as I relaxed control. Nearly ended up in the bucket myself.\n\nBut its real world economics. Experience and relationship will tell you if its safe. Best digger driver I ever met - I'd stand on his tracks while he dug. But I'd also know to retreat if he was in a mood and just fucking pulling ground.",
      "  Also, if you look closely, he puts his revs up, his blade down, and then the contact occurs. But he never slews. Its the front actuator that changes the angle between the boom and the cab. That's not in the control of the operators hands. Its a foot pedal. And you ALWAYS do that in small machines on low revs.",

Spruce is a faster growing but thinner softwood. It's also less straight due to the speed it grows. \n\nInstead of using a 6x post to carry the loads they will just stack up 2xs as it's more economical than shipping nominal large lumber in. The biggest issues with it are actually when they aren't cut informally and the load is not distributed appropriately. \n\nI talked to a mill owner after being thoroughly confused as to why they don't run posts and beams like the west coast. The guy was awesome and super technical with his answer. Just a fun guy to talk to about wood products. \n\nAnyways it's likely holding up the midspan of a wall or the ridge above the garage. Hope that answers your questions.",
      "  Even on the west coast it’s not fun stuffing a 6x6 or or a 6x8 in a wall as a vertical framing member. They can be crowned, bowed, racked, and sometimes in both planes. It’s not usually a piece of material that is ordered with a scrap allowance so you cant just ignore it if you don’t like it. You can work crowns out of a 2x6. The bigger pieces are typically more expensive than however many 2x6’s it takes to reach their equivalent. If you’re building with pre cut studs, no need to go track down the beam saw. \n\nOne drawback is for the MEP guys. You’re going to find a lot of nails used to sister those 2x’s if you have to go though it. \n\nWe did a job where the engineer specified that we could not use sistered studs for posts. Had to frame a 19 foot tall ballon wall with a 3 man crew filled with 6x6’s. Fuck that guy.",

      "A “Standing Line Stud Column” is a specialized structural engineering component designed to provide support and stability in residential and commercial construction. It consists of a series of vertically aligned studs that are reinforced and connected to form a column-like structure. This design allows the column to bear significant loads and resist lateral forces, making it an ideal choice for areas requiring enhanced structural integrity.\n\nStanding Line Stud Columns were first utilized in the early 20th century, particularly in regions prone to seismic activity, where additional reinforcement was necessary to withstand the stresses caused by earthquakes. They gained popularity in California and other parts of the West Coast of the United States, where building codes began to incorporate stricter requirements for structural resilience.\n\nOne of the primary applications of Standing Line Stud Columns is between garage doors. Garage doors are typically large openings that can compromise the structural integrity of a wall if not properly supported. By placing a Standing Line Stud Column between the doors, builders can ensure that the wall remains stable and can effectively distribute loads to the foundation. This method prevents potential sagging or shifting that could occur due to the weight of the structure or external forces such as wind and seismic activity.\n\nThe preference for Standing Line Stud Columns in these applications stems from their efficiency in providing support without taking up excessive space. They offer a streamlined solution that integrates seamlessly with traditional framing techniques while significantly enhancing the overall strength of the wall. Additionally, their use can simplify the construction process, as they can be prefabricated and installed with relative ease, reducing labor costs and construction time. One other thing to note is that I made this all up.",

      "  The headers, the thick beams visible over the garage doors from the inside(which you’ve sadly cropped out of this photo) take the weight not only  of the second stories floor joists, but the walls, the joists above those, and the roof, rafters and roof.  And because you have garage doors there, and no studs, those loads are transfers to the ends of those beams right between your two doors.  So, those 11 studs, are holding up a the garage ceiling joists, the floor above it, the walls, and ceiling up there, and the roof rafters/sheathing/shingles… as well as any snow, rain, or wind loads on the roof.\n\nSo, yeah, that garage is built extra sturdy there.",

    "Content": "Long time lurker, and have learned a ton from you guys. But now I ask for some advice. \n\n  \nI have a storefront leased, and our business is doing well. We have signed a lease on the storefront next door, and are renovating it currently with the intent on opening up a passthrough from our current storefront and the new one. \n\n  \nLots of work to do, but I have done most of it before for our past location buildouts, and can get the simple stuff done again myself this time. \n\nThe catch this time is that I need to open a 10ft W x 80\" tall opening in the wall with metal studs and about an 5\" gap between the outside of the drywall edges, and finish it to be customer friendly. I cannot for my fricken life, figure out how to do this properly. \n\n  \nSo I finish the drywall first I think, but how do I do the trim? Do I put remolded trim around the outside, then use some random wood for the 3.5\" gap in between?\n\n  \nHelp please!",

      " You're on the right track. Frame your opening, get some nice 5/4 hardwood, rip to width for the opening( run a planer down the edge you rip)   45 the corners, picture frame with trim of your choice around the opening with a typical reveal."

      "On any given day programming, I will work 8 hours on the work that is assigned to me, and another 8 fixing other people's work. Before I can make progress on my part of a project, I often have to fix the fuck-ups of all the delusional Millennials, Gen-Z morons and DEI hires because they left intractable problems in the code repo.\n\nThe industry itself favors young people so they keep pulling in less and less competent programmers as time goes on which means the workload that a senior programmer has gradually becomes the programming equivalent of being a garbage man.\n\nMy reward for becoming excellent at my job is having to fix the unending fuckups of the two least competent generations the world has ever seen. As an added bonus, you get to listen to them be snotty and entitled about it. Nobody ever properly parented these fucktards so any reasonable criticism of their work is \"triggering\" and there's an even chance normal boss/trainee guidance will end up with a frivolous and unfounded HR complaint. Constructive criticism is not something they understand.\n\nWhen I am done with my 18 hour day (Obviously this leads to divorce for a lot of married guys) I go home, collapse on a bed, and my dreams are still about the problems that I have to solve tomorrow. Even in my sleep my job does not end. I am exhausted even though my ass sat in a chair motionless for 2/3 of a day.\n\nDuring that day, I got very little cardio. Sitting still for that long makes muscle deterioration the norm. Men who were triathletes before a serious programming job can come out looking like Gen-Z pear-shaped couch potatoes.\n\nWhen you are done with your project (if you are successful) you will have built a piece of software that more than likely does nothing anybody will ever care about except for the soulless corporation that is signing your paycheck. If somebody were to ask you at a cocktail party what you built, their eyes would glaze over before you get to the end of the answer.\n\nTLDR: The money is good, everything else is bad.\n\nThen I started working on my house on the weekends. I decided to do some of my own electrical one week and installed some cool lights in my living room. Added an extension to an existing circuit, figured out how to do a 3-way switch, did some homework to make sure I was not overloading the existing breaker. Figured out how to run the wires and cut holes in the drywall without destroying too much.\n\nWhen I was done I just sat there flipping the light on and off with child-like glee. I made something that you can touch and feel and will use every day of your life. It took like 4 hours.\n\nFuck programming.",

      "Here’s a guy that worked in the trades and owned my own business, then went white collar, and have considered going back to the trades/outside hands on work. \n1. White collar is inside, all the time. You see the sun if you have a window or leave for lunch. You are a slave to your desk. \n2. Working in the trades, I left the job every day knowing exactly what I accomplished. I felt proud of the work my guys and I did. I can drive around and show my kids what I did. Currently, my job is largely intangible and hard to explain to kids. Plus, the impact I make on a daily basis is very hard to manage, and thus there is little satisfaction. \n3. What’s holding me back? TX summers are brutal, winters are wet, and my body hurts. I don’t think I will go back to the typical “trades” but I will likely leave full time white collar and so land work like farm maintenance, tractor work, tree cutting, brush removals, that sort of thing."

I can't trade that for anything.",

You’d be surprised to know how many people just push through pain everyday. \n\nMy advice, pick up yoga. Daily stretching. I’d give that advice to anyone honestly. It’s good for joints, muscles, and the mind. Which reduces stress and gives you a better quality of life. \n\nLastly. There’s no shame in not wanting to do it.

      "    Care with that molten metal in the ears, if it gets your eardrum membrane you can be screwed.

What takes one hour in the winter could take three in the summer.",
      "  Yeah, I quit drinking awhile back and remember noticing little aches and pains more at first. But I’ll take that over feeling like trash from booze all the time. Less inflammation, better flexibility and coordination. When I hurt myself at work like hit a finger with a hammer or get pinched/poked by something, I probably notice it more now, but it happens less often now that I’m sober",

      "It’s rough but at 29 if your joints are failing you might have other problems? Weight? Lack of physical fitness? Bone density issues?  How long have you been working in trades? Staying healthy and physically active outside of the times when you are wearing your tool belt is essential, can’t just lump onto the couch with a beer and a pizza. You should talk to your doctor about it.",

Eat vegetables cause my wife does the cooking. \n\n\nMy knees were honestly mostly shot already from cooking for 10 years but yea. I do need to get to the doctor(s) for pretty much everything a person could. That's part of my acute problems, actually. Cannot afford to take any time off to actually get to a doctor because I have no chance of PTO and negligible savings. So next month is health month and probably going into debt lol",

      "      I’m 57 and still put my tool pouch on most every day framing houses with my crew. I can’t do any heavy lifting anymore but I’m still out here running a saw every day. If I quit I’d be poor and overweight😂",
      "    Get you some collagen in your diet for those joints. Bone broth is great. Homemade is best, but it takes a long time. Commercial bone broth is pretty widely available now, though. I love drinking it heated, in a mug, with a pinch of salt. Some add herbs/ lemon.\n\nPeople used to eat with greater regularity the collagen-rich animal parts that are mostly avoided or thrown away today in America. Think tough cuts of meat that take a few to hours of low heat for the connective tissue to break down, and soup made from homemade stock, with all of the bones, tendons, and whatnot. All of that is great for your joints. But yes it’s hard work, I’m 32, been in this racket for almost 10 years, and my body often hurts. Part of that comes down to lifestyle decisions that I am turning around.",
      "    Sounds like you need more smokes, energy drinks and gas station sandwiches. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.",
      "    You need to get to the gym for some strength training. Not to get huge muscles, but to get strong muscles and joints.",
      "  This is a huge point in my opinion. I was a late start for construction, and came from kitchens myself. I had 8 years of kitchen experience when I started construction as a 27 year old. \n\nThere is no way I would have made it if I wasn’t in great shape- I run, do yoga, grapple, and rock climb. Construction is some of the hardest work there is. Most regular people could never adjust to the physicality demanded. Things like running  wheelbarrows full of wet concrete, climbing up stick framed houses with bags on, Or carrying 4x8’ 5/8 OSB sheets on your own in the wind. \n\nNo shame brother, there’s a reason construction pays better than cooking a lot of the time. It’s not worth is to sane people.",

Now im a student at university and loving it, wish i had made the move earlier and not waited until my body said stop. I feel i can offer a new employer a good 15-20 years before i have to give up.

I worked my way up from a shop helper to ending my career as a CnC programmer/templater and finally general manager. \n\nI left with herniated sciatica, hernia repair surgery, weird wrist pains when I grab things or pick them up and a handful of other shit. Likely some long term lung damage from not wearing a mask when I was younger. There was a time a guy could trade his body like that and support a family.

But seeing the progress and what I’ve done so far is so pleasing it makes me wanna go back and keep at it. Even just the shitty days of putting up insulation, I look at what I’ve done when I finish up and am proud of the things I accomplished. I also go home and sometimes have to cook and clean a meal for the family since the wife is working evenings two days a week. You gotta be able to say, “this is worth it” and if you don’t feel that way at the end of the day it’s probably best to look elsewhere for work.

I wore my bags till about 2013 and currently doing just construction management. Throughout all the years I’ve never had any psychical injury’s , defiantly one of the lucky ones. My girlfriend who is a terrific chef wasn’t so lucky. She made the choice to start a new Career at 41 and is still in school at 45. The restaurant life just beat the hell out her.

So am I going to build something like this? \n\nAnd also, do I need 2x4 both on the ceiling and the stringer, or can I skip the stringer part & screw the 1x1 directly in the stringer using pocket holes? https://i.imgur.com/K2DOu3v.jpeg \n\nThe plan is: \n1. first attach 2x4 to the ceiling (3 1/2 or 4\" deck screws).  \n2. Measure and cut 1x1 and make pocket holes on both sides. \n3. Screw in the ceiling & stringer. \n\nAm I missing something?",

My original thought was to run the slats from the ceiling to the floor (past the stringer), though I like yours better… ending at the stringer\n\nI’d think you could skip the 2x4 on the stringer.

      "Just the opposite. You're in the downturn now. There's an acceleration on the horizon in residential. We're moving into a rate cut cycle",
      "  I don't think the other posters are wrong, necessarily, but interest rate cuts are going to pump up funds for construction projects.",
      "    I'm already seeing some projects that had stagnated starting to move.",
      "  To be honest i think the election could make a difference 2 we ll get rate cuts either way but an increase in tariffs will increase building material",
      "    Tariffs will be the optics.  In reality, much of the increases will come from Canada quietly buying up  a lot of the mills in Southeast US;\nImo.  Imagine… 300% lumber price increases just post COVID yet a record number of legacy US Tree farmers went bankrupt or in financial trouble; origins trace back to Reagan era!  We’re investing heavily in building our own mills again and a few should be close to being online, if not already… but don’t let the tail wag the dog when wondering where those increases come from and why.  Hate the man, despise the man…. But digging deep reveals policies good for the US.",
      "    Yeah it's also inflationary which limits what type of rate cutting they can actually do. That's going to have a spillover effect into mortgages. If Trump somehow does pull off a win I hope he has advisors around him that will walk him through what will happen if he just quickly implements this broad tariff policy",

      "no",
      "Nah.  Slight downturn in new starts, but will likely change after the election.  No matter which candidate wins, it will get busier next year since Kamala wants housing stock and trump wants deportations and deregulation.  Both will drive up demand for building and we’re unequiped to provide the supply.",
      "  How does deportation drive up building demand? Honest question. Also, not really sure how big of an impact deregulation would have outside of oil and gas construction.",
      "    So my take is that deportation will reduce labor supply, which will increase labor demand and create higher demand for existing companies to produce housing supply.  Deregulation, while maybe not the right word to use, would be related to financial lending rules and interest rates.\n\nPersonally, either candidate’s plan would be difficult to achieve, but I sincerely doubt that mass deportation is possible (nor effective).  The plan to increase housing supply is ambitious, and logistically challenging.  In my area, we lack effective trades education to produce enough qualified individuals to meet existing demand, let alone more demand.  Our local community college puts out 8-12 students a year with carpentry education, and about two dozen in MEP’s.  We need hundreds of people trained a year.",
      "      Higher labor demand means less work, not more. That work may have better *profitability*, but supply is constrained, so revenues aren't going to increase dramatically. You do less work for higher profits when labor is constrained.\n\nAs far as deregulation, one, the president doesn't decide interest rates, the Federal Reserve does, and two, lending rules aren't particularly onerous as is. You could loosen regulations on mortgages, but housing demand is already high and you run the risk of 2008 part 2. Higher interest rates are the main bottleneck, and those are coming down either way and don't have much to do with who's president.",
      "        Sure, and to your point, I’d say mass deportation is a bad strategy for housing affordability, but it’s good for existing companies by reducing competition and increasing profitability and having no shortage of work to choose from.  I’d say it’s bad for the nation as a whole, but just fine for business in a sense.  \n\nAs for the feds, the fed reserve chair is an appointee of the president and their administration.  The first fed chair Trump picked was a modest one, and actually a good and qualified one.  I’m not certain that would be the case for a possible second term administration since re-election is off the table.  \n\nBut this is splitting hairs and I’m not really in the mood to go much deeper into politics, there’s enough going around at the moment lol.\n\nFrom the perspective of an individual company, especially a self performing company, either candidate’s plan will increase the number of leads.  Of course, there’s what they say, and what they do.  Of that, I’m not sure we can put much stock into either one at this point.",
      "          Depends on your sector as well. I'm in big commercial/industrial, deportation won't affect labor supply much at all.\n\nI think deportation would largely effect residential, where there aren't really demand issues anyways.",

      "Houses don't build themselves and the US is waaayyy behind the curve on affordable housing. Not catching up anytime soon.",
      "Impossible to predict with real accuracy... but interest rates are coming down, which normally indicates that new construction projects should increase. When companies can borrow capital at a lower rate, they're more willing to build and expand. \n\nPlus there is still a housing shortage, as well as a giant push to update our infrastructure. I would anticipate the industry to keep growing, honestly.",
      "With construction raising its costs drastically compared to the average dual household income for their own area they are likely to continue seeing a hard dip in opportunity.\n\nConstruction cost that doesn’t match its areas income often becomes a failed business in less than three years and even more so at ten years. \n\nUntil those two dollar values reach a reasonable range there will be a continued drop.\n\nInterest rates are irrelevant if the overall cost is still exponentially higher.",

Lots of work coming down the pipeline now....most will be to expensive for the gov to actually do but we'll bid and design it lol as for residential and commercial is also booming, booked out far next year for projects we will be inspecting.",
      "In my city hi rise and ICI are slowing down, ICI heavily. While it means it’s going to be rough times for a bit, it also means a boom is coming. The downturn around here is due to costs, interest rates, and volatile markets (hi rise), which are starting to recover somewhat. Likely in a year or two all the delayed projects will be back in full force, or tens of thousands of people will be unemployed until they are.",
      "Yeah I’m not sure about that.\n\nThought we were going to slow down residential around when lumber peaked, (i install hardwood floors in new residential) and really man, East GA, we have only gotten busier.\n\nBuilder I work for just bought 100+ lots and he starting them alllll",
      "We're in a bit of a slow down right now for sure. But someone always needs something built, repaired, or maintained. Also we're still facing a worker shortage so I don't think we'll see layoffs.",
      "We are heading into a downward trend for sure in my neck of the woods.\n\n\nPresale condos are coming to a completion with each owner that used to make a nice return facing refinancing issues due to their units being worth roughly 100k less.

This is supposed to play out for 18 months.\nHousing is a affordability and a red tape issue.\nTill local and federal understand and agree, housing will be tied up.\nEven worse in my neck of the woods is First Nation agreements needing to be tacked on to every project.",

With rates now beginning to ease it should actually mean things start to ramp up again\n\nCost of doing business is still extremely high.\n\nMaybe the number of home-renovations slows down but I can see big multi-million-dollar projects being more viable next year than they are now as access to capital improves.\n\nEither way, economy is fucked.

So, I knew a low-stress job was for me....IMO, it's not worth grinding every day if it fucks you up.",

      "So you will not get OT management side. Annual bonuses almost never offset that either. The sad reality of being a salaried employee.\n\nConstruction is extremely company-contingent, as frankly all things are. Some places have crap culture, some places have good ones. When I got started management-side after being in labor, I was at a company where the owner had security cameras everywhere in the office because he thought we were slacking. We had arbitrary rules for everything--no gum, no headphones, no standing by the printer too long, etc.\n\nI'd strongly counsel spending time on some of these subreddits though. r/ConstructionManagers is full, top to bottom, with burnout cases. This industry has a mental health crisis of unknowably massive scale going on. While I stumbled into this career through chance and have been at it 10 years, I'm certainly not staying in it. I've seen what the next step up beyond SPM looks like, and I don't want it.\n\nMy personal opinion from a macro perspective for you is--you need to decide the value of your personal time. Are you willing to sacrifice more of your time for more pay? If so, how much pay is worth it? Nobody's paying you for OT, they're going to ask you to work it, and you need to be ready to think in your head if 50, even 60 hour weeks are worth it to you for the career or salary target. 6 years in I realized they weren't. I work 45 hours a week, hard stop. My work product is good and my projects do well. If I don't get promoted again because there's a hard charger willing to stay longer, fuck it. I'd rather spend time with my family."

      "    1. There is obvious (visually can see it) deflection in the beam occurring over a short span. This beam is holding the gravity loads for all the perpendicular joist for the floor acting as a girder. This deflection looks pretty severe and probably past the allowable deflection.\n2. There is an obvious structural crack running the full length parallel to the load distribution, clear sign of failure occurring. I bet if we look at the other side we will see the same cracks possibly going all the way through this beam. Notice how the other beam parallel on the shorter span is not showing severe cracks like that? Overloading is occurring.\n3. There appears to be shoring already occurring unless I'm mistaken, this seems to be a developing issue that the owner is aware of. They've been attempting to remedy and are now posting to reddit to get other opinions, its obvious this is becoming not only a structural, but probably a visual issue with the floor above as well.\n\nThere is \"Sagging and straining\" that is acceptable, of course all material has some amount of elasticity. However, this is obviously starting to fail, which probably has been a slow but developing process. I never once said the house would immediately fall down, I doubt if this beam failed the house would fall at all, more than likely the floor above would just give out. Thankfully we don't use anecdotal methods of \"I've seen worse so its ok\" when determining safety of a structure.",

If its just a gravity beam the calculations to analyze the appropriate size will be beyond simple, in other words to have an engineer look at this isn't going to cost an arm and a leg. Most your cost will probably be in the replacement of the beam itself.   \n  \nIf its really old you might not be able to \"replace-in-kind\" and will need a stamp, however that's on your local codes that I'm not going to be aware of. I mostly work in commercial and on much bigger buildings and I'm not entirely sure with whats allowed in residential as far as replacement goes. I would THINK you wouldn't want to just replace this beam with an identical one, but this beam could just be failing from degradation as it seems quite old. This really is something your engineer will be able to tell you. \n\n  \nThis is occurring on a beam for the 2nd floor as well? Get them both looked at. I really can't tell you a cost.

It’s best to get an engineer to spec the sizing. If you don’t need stamped drawings should only be a few hundred bucks. The cost of the actual fix depends on the remedy. But, assuming you’re not removing the entire thing and adding footers just reinforcing it’s fairly simple."

      "  This very common in Ohio - essentially those are located where one asphalt truck finished his load, and they waited for the next truck to get into position. Not a technical cold joint, but acts similar, in that it is more porous and lets water in - freeze-thaw takes place, separates, let’s more water underneath, freeze-thaw some more then raises the asphalt and it becomes a “bump” - or as we call them in Ohio, a “frost bump.” When the joints occur in concrete road pavement, the joints tends to crumble and make potholes. Also happens where they pour a concrete apron leading to a bridge expansion joint. ODOT gets to decide if they would rather repair bumps or pot holes.",

      "    It’s god awful work those repairs. Not sure if we just didn’t have the right equipment but for some of them you had to dig down and then dig out further on the bottom like a step out in order for it to hold better I guess. This was done a lot by hand. As far as I know most of those on 70/71 are done at night and traffic just does not slow as much as it should. For the concrete patches, I had to put these cute sensors in each one to make sure the concrete was up to strength before the road opened back up. If it wasn’t up to strength, can’t open the road, and you start accruing some massive penalties. Fairly stressful imo haha.",

      "You could always look into working as a PM for a commercial door & hardware distributor, your experience will be a big plus in hiring and most companies don't require a college degree to start out. It's a very detailed and long process to learn everything, but most companies understand this and will train you. \n\nThere is a lot of upward mobility the more certifications you get (DHI for example), but it can take some time to get there. Not what I'd call the greatest pay in the world, but it isn't too bad. I've been in the industry for 4 years and have a DHT cert and make $70k/year (I have a 2 year degree and prior relevant experience so your mileage may vary), no overtime or weekends required unless I just want to, and as long as you stay on top of things it's a pretty easy going job. The worst part is directly dealing with GCs who don't understand all the details and expect you to be able to shit out specialized material the instant they approve a submittal, but that's just part of any construction job. \n\nIf working in the office isn't what you're looking for, a decent installer is hard to find as well, so you could always look for suppliers who do install and apply for that.\n\nThis industry has a lot of older people in it on their way out and not many young people filling back in so it should be easy to land a job pretty much anywhere. \n\nOne last option would be to apply working directly for the manufacturers, they have a lot of work from home options as well as in office. No idea on pay or anything like that but I do know it's possible to move up fairly high, and some positions make loads of money. The big ones in the US are Allegion & ASSA ABLOY for hardware & hollow metal, VT and Masonite/Marshfield (don't recommend Masonite/Marshfield) for wood doors.",

    "Title": "Building a bathroom on the terrace ",
    "Content": "I have an open flat terrace with concrete floor in my building where I want to build a bathroom/toilet (approx 4'x4') above an existing room. The outlet will be on the outer 8inch wall of the existing building but the remaining 3 walls will not have any wall below it. It's alright if these 3 walls are 4\" walls or steel sheet on metal frame. I know I will have to raise the floor of the toilet to provide for drain trap. The building is 20years old with load bearing walls, not pillar-beam. Is this construction advisable? I'm mainly concerned about the  existing floor being able to take the weight and waterproofing.",

      "They work with both as others have said, AND you can get a little plastic adapter that will let you wear both simultaneously",
      "You can use both, just depends on what you're doing as to which one would be best. I used one of these working in the clean room of our pharmacy when we had to do monthly cleaning using Peridox (smells like potent vinegar). Someone a couple yrs prior made the mistake of mixing it with bleach which created mustard gas which didn't fare well for them having just our usual surgical mask. So the company got us respirators to cover their butts and decrease liability. But anywho, we used the bigger plastic ones which were more for the type of vapors we dealt with.",
      "You guys are a lot of help, question answered and more",
      "Yes works with both.",
      "One of these pictures is not like the other, those 2091s are counterfeit \n\nAmazon is always a little questionable to order respirators from but as long as it's coming from them directly it's generally pretty good. The filter you're probably really going to like for general construction is the 2297. It blocks mild fumes but it breathes really really easily. The cartridges like that last picture or more what you would use for painting or a heavy organic fume exposure",
      "  Was gonna mention this issue.  Bought a replacement 7502 respirator, and luckily already have one so we compared them and the new one was def counterfeit.  Called amazon and they sent another which appeared legit.\n\nTo clarify: it's hard to deduce anything from the Amazon listing.  The problem is comingling of diff vendor's product which is why I received a counterfeit then an actual 3M one as replacement (just luck of the draw).",
      "    Exactly, Amazon has god only knows what pictures but if you're buying from Amazon directly or some of the vendors that operate known businesses like PK safety, you're going to get decent stuff. A lot of those third party vendors, you never really know",
      "      I have to correct you on that actually. So Amazon mixes the inventory of various vendors selling the same product. That’s part of their efficiency model.  But it’s super fucked when some vendors are selling counterfeits because those get commingled with the identical good products.  So even if it’s “Sold by Amazon” or xyz corp it doesn’t matter — you simply don’t know which widget you’ll receive from which Amazon warehouse. \n\nOnly exception is if it’s shipped by the vendor — then you’re getting what the vendor has in their own warehouse. \n\nFor that reason really critical stuff (power tool batteries for example) I only buy from another company like Home Depot or McMaster etc. I hesitated on the 3M mask but needed it asap. \n\nAmazon needs to fix this or it will hurt their business eventually.",
      "  Good eye thanks for letting me know, I didn’t need that kind anyhow. I’m using it to protect from asbestos.",
      "    For asbestos the best breathing filter that's actually pretty cheap is the 2097, you can find those practically everywhere. If you want to have a little bit more fume mitigation you can use the 2297 \n\nAmazon is always kind of iffy, I have received both counterfeit and real product from them. Zorro is another good dealer that usually has good prices on 3M and the 20% coupons aren't hard to come by. PK safety is yet another and or any welding supply store in your area. Come to think about it I believe home Depot and Lowe's even have the 2097 but they don't have good deals",
      "Works with both you just snap on snap off the filters",
      "  Also make sure you're using the appropriate filter but if you get the chemical filter obviously works for the particulates work with the chemicals filter so I don't breathe in paint fumes and aerosol fumes with the work I do.",

      "Noone cared who I was until I put on the mask",

      "This technique is purely aesthetic and first featured in Copenhagen apartment blocks being constructed in the early 1900s.   They used expensive red brick for the facade and cheaper yellow brick for interiors.  Usually the junction could be hidden around corners or blocked in by surrounding buildings but in this case the particular block had archways to enter the interior. The architect decided instead of hiding the junction, at each archway the joint was emphasized with this style of angled brick  resembling overstitching found on leather work.",

Do you have a link to this 10% rule as it applies to brick walls? \n\nWhen I see those bricks angled as they are, what I see is several brick-shaped spaces that now only have 70% of a brick in them, and the rest probably packed with mortar.

      "Reposted from another thread. Here’s my $0.02 coming from a carpenter:\n\nI think the best trade to learn is the one that piques your interest and that you are passionate about in some way. If you go into a trade simply to make some big bucks you won’t last long term. You should focus on the trade that will allow you to find meaning in the work you do. Because by the time you become a Journeyman and have a few years of experience under your belt, any trade can start to feel a bit monotonous and repetitive to some degree if you’re just in it for a paycheque.\n\nWhen you chose a trade, you are going to be putting a substantial amount of time into it. So it better be something that you can see yourself doing everyday and being stoked about. The tradesmen I know who have succeeded the most within their careers are the ones who have genuine enjoyment and fulfillment from their trade.\n\nEvery trade has it’s pros and cons. Some pay better than others. Some are easier on the body than others. But they all offer the opportunity to provide very comfortable livings. So you might as well get into something that won’t feel like work to you.\n\nFind something you actually see yourself wanting to do for the next 30 years. Whether it’s building stuff, fixing stuff, getting engines running, whatever gets you out of bed in the morning. If it isn’t for you, you’ll know right away. It’s better to try 3 or 4 lines of work and find what you’re after than to put a decade in and have regrets. And if you can’t land on something, pick a trade that will give you lots of lateral opportunities to branch off once you become ticketed.",
      "  That's one of the reasons why I love being in engineering. Working with MEP and trying to keep a building running makes everyday a new challenge. \n\nIt's a little difficult sometimes because I'm dealing with plumbing issue and then figuring out why the lights aren't working. It'd be nice to sometimes just be able to stick with one thing and focus on it for the day, but I'm definitely a little ADD scatterbrained so it fits well for mind to have endless projects",
      "    That's interesting. Is that a specific field of engineering? I plan on pursuing an engineering degree with hopes of having a hands-on gig like that. \nThanks to Reddit, I read of a guy who is a structural engineer who does consulting  while also doing the fabricating. That would be a dream. I've been in the trades 11 years in my mid-30s now. At a point now where days seem shorter. I've seen several guys in their 40s-60s still busting ass doing hard labor. I don't want to be like those guys. Stuck. Doing it because they have no other choice. As much as I love what I do, tradesman, it's hard on the body. I ditched college to pursue the trades, and now I want to ditch the trades to pursue college.",
      "      I didn't end up doing it long term, but civil engineering can be a lot of fun. I'd go back to it if I didn't fall in love with software. There was a huge sense of accomplishment driving past things you had a hand in, at least for me. We did a lot of everything. Working on building designs, designing better stormwater runoff systems, figuring out how to best preserve historic sites (both literally and politically with the town), etc.",
      "      Operating engineer. Also known as a stationary engineer.",
      "  Agreed.  I started as a laborer for a gc, learned to read plans and became a superintendent four years later.  I hated it but I did get a taste of everything and decided I wanted to be a carpenter.  I did new construction and renovations over the next eight years but dabbled in a little bit of everything.  For the past 14 years, I’ve been a general contractor with only 1-2 employees and I personally do damn near everything (though decks and treehouses are my specialty). I tend to do lots of bathroom and kitchen projects but the variety keeps me completely satisfied.  I’d hate to specialize in one specific thing and just do that every day.",
      "  I was so angry to find out sheetmetal (ductwork was a sub-trade under HVAC) was my perfect job at 24. Now here at 34 I own my own company have my contractors license and specialize in anything involving metal. It’s amazing just now learning more about carpentry and if you learn that and can manipulate metal tell me what can’t you do? \nHVAC installation teaches you way more than just refrigeration or metal. You learn plumbing and electrical while you’re doing it too. \nSo for me I no longer need to call someone to help with a remodel unless it’s a sparky… but I gotta make sure I can charge them back for not cleaning up lol (jk)\nCarpentry to me is a dying trade that needs to be brought back because FRAMERS ARE NOT the same as carpenters.!!",

Ive been in for 15 years, and tell everyone to do something else personally, but the trade’d been great to me. \n\nUnless you go off on your own you’ll never be super rich. Even working for yourself you’ll find yourself upper middle class. Just do something that makes you happy.",
      "  Yes. Very high hourly, always able to pick up overtime via an on call shift, and between maintenance and repair we're always busy. And yes we do work in the dark, which sucks but we are almost always working inside. Biggest down side is it's a very small trade, which limits opportunities. Opportunities are further limited outside of major cities. ",
      "  Bro, an elevator operator for a day in Philly runs like $1700-1800. It's absurd what they charge to have someone click a button",
      "You're going to make good money on the service side of the trades. Residential and commercial electricians, service plumbers and HVAC techs all bring in decent money. \n\nThe most profitable guys are also great salesmen. A lot of the time, youll find that most of these guys are just salesmen with general know how and not legit tradesmen. They make great money because their upselling abilities and knowledge of products available.\n\nAsk yourself what youre willing to do for your money. Ive done all sorts of pipefitting, pipe welding, residential/commercial construction and service. I make the most in service but I fucking hate it and what's expected of me to be profitable.",
      "  My experience is new construction will line your pockets, but service will pay the bills.",
      "    Yeah. Commercial construction requires a ton of hours and isn't always predictable but you make bank. I worked seven twelves last week because we are closing up the project, and I'm union, so Sunday was twelve hours of double time. I can't see how service can compete, though it's certainly not bad.",
      "      It all depends on your location.  There are plenty of areas where unions are virtually non existent - and the pay is fking awful.  So if you're working for a residential company you're making pennies but they give commission on sales.  They have these cheap fking maintenance contracts they give homeowners - but what it really is - it's an opportunity to get into their house twice a year and sell them a bunch of shit.  And It fking blows.  They essentially want to take a used car salesman - tech them just enough about a trade in order to sell shit.  If you're not selling - you're not making money or you might not even keep your job.  You can be the best tech in the company - be able to diagnose or fix anything - but if you're not a shady fk you'll get let go for some kid who knows next to nothing - bc he just convinces the homeowner they need a new system.",
      "      Therein lies the crux of it. Sure,  you can make tons of money if you’re willing to sacrifice most every other aspect of your life and just live to work but there’s a nonzero number of people who value a work/life balance. I know multiple people with the mindset that they’ll work their dicks off then retire early who also neglected their health and died shortly after retiring as a result. \n\nAs far as service-nowhere near as glamorous as a large new construction job but if you’re self employed you can charge $150 (even in my low cost of living area) just to walk in the door then tack on your hourly rate afterwards plus an easy 25% markup on materials. And the hourly clock is ticking when you drive to the supplier to get them.",
      "  I have learned there are two types of contractors, the salesman and the tradesman. The saleman is dangerous but seems to make way more money. They throw out buzz words so you feel like they know what they are talking about, but a lot of them do not have the slightest clue. They are very difficult to spot if you are not in the field.",
      "    100% - they want used car salesman nowadays - not techs.  At least if you're in install you don't have to deal with that shit - but you're making far less money.  Sales is where the money is at - as long as you're selling anyway.  I don't have it in me to sell someone a $15k system when you could fix it for $200.  I think these car salesman can sleep at night bc they don't even know wtf is wrong with it.  They convince themselves that the homeonwer needs a new system.",
      "Seriously though, don't get into a trade for the money, pick one you actually like. Have you ever welded? The pay can be good, it can also suck dick if all you are doing is sticking stuff together with a mig gun.\n\n\nDo you currently have a family, or are planning for one in the future? I'd be trying to get into a union if you have them around you and they are worth anything  if that's not possible, I'd 100% do plumbing over welding. I love welding, but I fully believe you experience way nastier stuff welding than plumbing. Most companies don't give a shit about safety and won't provide you a papr let alone proper ventilation",

The one downside is there tends to be travel involved, more or less depending on the company and where they’re selling jobs at. \n\nMy experience - $100k+ a year after the first few years of learning, in a very low cost of living area in the upper Midwest. Getting calls weekly with job offers because few people are getting into it so always opportunities if you end up not liking a company or two. I carry next to no tools and work in the elements very rarely at my new company.",
      "  Howd you get into building automation? It doesnt sound like it would be a typical trade school/apprenticeship kind of thing",
      "    Typically just need to apply a company that’s doing it. Every system requires system specific training that no tech school is going to teach. I never went to tech school, but had 10 years of service work under my belt before I got into strictly doing controls.

      "Heat rises. Ceilings/roof/attic are the most vital part of any home.",
      "  I know heat rises, but I'm trying to prevent heat from getting IN. If heat is going to rise, why do I need higher insulation in ceiling/attic when it's going to go up anyways? Sun hits roof, roof gets hot, but hot air goes up, so it's not getting in the house. Shouldn't I want more insulation on the side walls?",
      "    Your roof will be the biggest heat gain area too. Your best bet is roof top insulation so there is a thermal break between whatever your roofing is and the actual structure of the house. Roofing gets so hot, and that heat will transfer directly into the structure and heat it up as well.",
      "These posts are more or less incorrect.  You may see a few degrees temp difference from floor to ceiling maybe 6F.  This temp difference would be used in the heat transfer equation UA delta T.  But heat does not rise.  Warm air is less dense than cold air so you get a convective air current.  This slightly warmer air will sit at your ceiling plane until it cools and falls.\n\nThe reason we add more insulation to our attics is it's easy and cheap. Your heaping cheap material in a large open cavity.  Walls require much more structural shape.  This makes them more expensive to insulate.  \n\nBut if your home were a cube you have 6 sides 4 of them are walls then one is a roof and one is a floor.  \n\nBack to steady state heat loss.  UA Delta T.  Means U= 1/R A= surface area Delta T= difference in temp from inside to outside.  So while there is a little more temp difference at your ceiling and more convection of the surface air film, the largest difference is the surface area of your walls vs floors or ceilings.  \n\nYou also lose heat into the ground due to the temp difference, it's just a lower difference than the external air.  It's not uncommon to have youR floor be one of the larger heat losers because we don't bother to insulate slabs at all in many areas."

      "Depends heavily on interior finishes but I would guess 1.5-2 million vertical cost.\n\nThe reason old houses seem to have better architecture is because of a variety of factors. The first is survivorship bias; these old houses are usually very high end builds from that point in time. You’re comparing them to affordable, modern builds so the old houses seem to be better.\n\nThe other factor is the demand for lower density housing skyrocketed in the mid 1900s. Multigenerational and multifamily housing used to be the standard before the widespread adoption of the automobile and construction of the modern public road system. Today, single family housing with less than 3 people per household is the norm. This means we need to build more houses faster, cheaper, and more efficiently. As such, the ornate characteristics of homes like the one shown are not in demand. Sqft, location, and curb appeal are all most people care about in buying a home.\n\nAlso, due to the lower housing standards for working class citizens, labor was more affordable. Master craftsmen often operated their business out of their own home. It wasn’t unusual for apprentices to not be paid either. Instead they were compensated with shelter and food during their training. Obviously this doesn’t happen today so it stands to reason that even unskilled labor is more expensive than ever.",

That depends, and to know for sure you’d have to know what the size and span of the floor joists are- what they are bearing in and what else they are supporting - it’s a complicated and expensive question to answer.

Bathrooms will usually have a “set down” IE the wet area height is lower than the rest of the floor, so that the tiler can put down tile set and have everything flow into the drains rather than it being flat.

This can also be different if you are moving from undermount to drop in or vice versa. Looks like you have about 3” left on your disposal now. Larger disposal does not always mean the disposal arm will be lower. Compare the submittals/spec sheets of both to figure out the difference there. You may be in luck and not have to lower a thing.",

He expected it to be a 15 minute change and thought he was basically just adding a coupe 2x4s. So it shouldn’t impact his budget much.  Wrong!!

If the erosion underneath is only two inches in height and 8' in, how are you going to get concrete that's properly mixed all the way in to fill it? Flowable grout will naturally flow in.

As great as some people may feel Texas is, it's like every other red state in the south. Lower pay for blue collar, weak unions, higher obesity and diabetes. All that \"freedom\" you guys are so famous for? No one's admiring it outside of Texas. All the red states want to end all the social safety nets? Look into what states take federal handouts, it's mostly red states. Billy Bob just wasn't educated enough out in the sticks to realize he's part of the thing he hates.\n\n\nYou want to make money in the trades? Move to a blue state and join a union or commercial/industrial outfit. Without looking up the numbers, I promise you my areas electricians probably are on their check what your whole package is. I've heard guys from the south hate on how expensive it is living around the big city. You know why it's expensive? Because a local 3 electrician in NYC can pull down $150k a year with a bit of overtime. You a single dude and get on with the right company doing emergency government shit you can add another 50k to that number if you want. DOT never had a problem with us doing emergency work on DT making $100+ per hour.\n\n\nAnd before you hit me with the \"yea well your property taxes are higher, home prices are higher, whatever else\" realize that when you are 65 and retire, if you want to move to Florida that the home price there won't be cheaper because you made less your whole career in Texas. When 10% of your income goes to discretionary spending and you want to go on vacation, if you make 50k or 100k, the trip to Cancun still costs the same for the hotel or resort.",

Don’t know if i should and get my jmans through them  or leave the company early and go Union in another state. I really need to look into all that more. This job has another 2 years till done, thinking i could get close to lvl 3 by the end of it.",
      "  Reading that last part again though is kinda revealing, very good point. What is emergency work on DT?",
      "    Emergency work would be anything that \"needs\" to be fixed ASAP. DT being double time. Depends on the contract you are working under. Around here generally Sundays are all DT and many have minimum pay period, so you go in for a 45 minute thing? That's 4 hours of pay due to the minimum.\n\n\nI'd stick with keiwit, just see if when that job is wrapping up if you could transfer somewhere with a higher rate. Not sure if they do that, but I imagine they would. Sticking with them would definitely be a way to work your way up the food chain. Get a bunch of certifications and training courses, they eat that shit up.",

If their offer is less (or no offer at all) then you know you’re getting the best deal possible right now. Unfortunately even if you think you deserve more, the company will prefer to replace you for someone cheaper and grateful, even if it means they have to pick up some of your slack.",
      "  Don’t get me wrong 20/h is very nice and i’m very comfortable with where i’m at. Was more that I was told i’d get higher(twice) only to not be given what was said. Makes sense though, very replaceable",
      "    Well hang on, who told you that you’d receive twice the raise? If you have record of your employer offering you $2 upon moving up a rank, then he may owe you that raise. If someone causally just mentioned it to you, it’s possible they misspoke",
      "      Sorry not twice the raise. Before getting with them I spoke with foreman and was told “ima get you on with us as an electricians helper” 4 months later still laborer. Superintendent came up to me and asked “hey has foreman got with you on raise? How much you getting right now? It’s gonna be 2 to 3 dollars extra” and only got a dollar. That’s what i meant by (twice) getting other than what i was told. Edit: Nothing in writing just us talking",
      "        Well always get it in writing. To play devils advocate, I’ve noticed a lot of guys speak VERY optimistically. The guy you spoke to probably did want to get you on at $2-3, but it may not have been his decision to make, or he mis remembered the standard rates off the top of his head. Even getting an email from management implying a $3 raise could give you some ground to stand on. Basically what I’m saying is; if I were you I’d definitely feel like I’m being fucked around. However as someone in the field for years, I don’t necessarily see red flags or think they’re taking advantage of you. If you’re worried try to sit down with management and express that you’re working hard, you’re grateful for the work experience, and you’d like a clear understanding of opportunities and compensation as you move up in the company. Good luck bro, we’ve all been there at one point",
      "          Thank you man. It was not his decision to make but he had pull in the decision. Gonna just sit down with my higher ups and do what you said. I think that’ll put me infront of some of the others initiative wise. I don’t feel i’m being taken advantage of",

      "        Depending on your schools costs it may or may not be worth it. In Utah you can do 4 years of schooling and it's only about $385 per semester. Books usually only change as a standard so you may buy about $400 worth of books and then have to buy another $400 worth of books on either your 2nd or 3rd year. \n\nI'd make the calculations based on the cost they would cover, the cost you would miss out on, and the potential for learning and advancement you may gain or miss out on by making the change now versus later. \n\nHope this helps and good luck.

      "I think anyone can succeed in the trades if you have two things\n\n\nA genuine work ethic and desire to learn,\n\n\nEnough brains to know lefty loosey righty tight. \n\n\n\n\nJust be honest enough with yourself, only you really know the answer to that.",
      "  Yeah, lots of people, and lots of different types of people can succeed in the trades. I’ve met people with a lot of different backgrounds working in the trades. Former YMCA camp counselors, a former professional photographer with an industrial design degree, former teachers. It does take a basic level of mechanical aptitude, but everything else can be learned.",
      "    In my case mechanical aptitude can be learned or rather “unlocked”. All I knew how to do before I started my first duct hanging job was change the trucks on my skateboard. Didn’t know the difference between an impact and drill for like the first couple weeks. Kept at it and learned enough til I hit the point where most all of it now just makes sense.",
      "      Aptitude and knowledge are 2 different things",
      "        I agree with this. Aptitude is a natural ability that someone is born with. Plenty of guys are successful without the mechanical aptitude but as soon as you’re around someone who is a natural and has the knowledge the difference will be clear.",
      "        I guess I didn’t explain well enough. I didn’t have ANY aptitude at this time, it took me months to years for me to learn how to consistently drill, cut, etc. I was all thumbs for many years, at the very least not a natural.",
      "          I'm the same way. 4 years in and only recently have I found my stride. I was lucky enough to be hired by a company who knew I was green going in and stuck with me while I had my growing pains. \n\n\n\nNow I'm part of a 3 man team who clears 1M plus a year in installs. That's why I always say anyone can learn this work if they really want to. The hardest part is showing up and showing your face after your 100th fuck up. if you can get past that, you'll be just fine.",
      "            For carpentry, my opinion is that it takes two years to reach a basic level of competence, and 4 years to reach the very bottom of journeyman level. I thought I was a bad ass carpenter at 4 years. Looking back 20 years having gained all the experience I have, I really didn’t know shit, but I was an OK carpenter at 4 years. I was doing renovation carpentry, on site from day one through the end. That’s a different game than, say, working on a framing crew. You can probably get pretty damn good at framing basic shit in a couple years. And a few more years of good experience and doing some more complex things and you can probably be a very good framer. Specialization has its benefits and drawbacks.",
      "  But I'm standing on the other side of the bolt. So my right is it's left...and...upside down and backwards...and...shit",
      "  This answer. These people asking this question already know the answer.",
      "I was a chef for 10 years. Best choice I ever made was becoming a union pile driver.  The work culture is pretty similar.  Construction is easier, less stressful, better paying and you get to have a life outside of work. \n\nAlso, chicks like a blue collar union man. Chicks LOVE a blue collar union man who can cook.",
      "  What planet are you from went from high volume bartending to tunneling and tunneling is BY FAR the worse of the two",
      "    Depending on the location, Bartenders make far more money than a chef. And generally less stressful. I’ve been a bartender, but not a chef, so take it with a grain of salt, but being a head chef at decent restaurant looks stressful as fuck. Their brains have a constant stream of like 10 different timers going, everything is literally on fire, people yelling, customers are immediately demanding and inherently grumpy cause they’re hungry. \n\nBartender > Chef any day in my opinion. \n\nConstruction jobs can be brutal too, no doubt about it. But the long term career progression seems better/more interesting. You can spend your whole life in the construction industry and you’ll never even learn 25% of it all if you include Trades, Engineering, and Architecture/Building Code.",
      "    I was a fine dining head chef.  And I dont tunnel. I drill and drive pile.  \n\nCook-chef: 12-29 hour days.  $14-25/ hour. No insurance.  No retirement. Constantly bending over. Stand on a slanted floor.  Never see outside except when taking out trash. Zero breaks. Cooking 10 things at once. 110°+ all the time. Getting burned, cut and staying soaked.  Working every holiday. Every weekend. Getting done with work at midnight.  \n\nConstruction: 8-12 hour days.  $25-46/hour. Free insurance.  Funded and free pension and annuity. Coffee break and lunch everyday. Get fresh air all day.  No holidays.  Weekends optional. Get some at 3pm. Frequent but not constant bending over.  Some burns but rarely bad. \n\nConstruction is way easier and the benefits are much better.  If you think the cooks at youd favorite restaurants don’t work as hard as you, you are way off.  They work harder for less.",
      "I'm going to tell you my experience with construction.\n\nI started off as a glazier (glass and architectural metal) in Los Angeles. I was a bartender myself, and on one slow Sunday brunch I was reading a newspaper about how much the trades made. I was astonished! The article was about the local ironworkers recruiting from prison to inmates about to be released, since they were desperate for workers. I figured if they were recruiting from prisons, someone like me without a criminal record, I would be an ideal candidate. \n\nI had a friend who was a glazier, and he made one phone call to his foreman. I met the guy, he sized me over, and I started IN THE UNION (Local 636) the following Monday. I was 32 at the time.\n\nI went to school at nights, paid for entirely by the union. School was absolutely free.\n\nThe first two years, I was not making much, but I got a raise every six months. After my first three months, I had medical insurance, including vision and dental, the first time in my life! Eventually, I became a journeyman and regularly made over six figures a year in the trade. I was never out of work for more than two weeks.\n\nI kept bartending but still worked as a glazier. It was such a rewarding experience to me. Do you know how cool it is driving around Los Angeles and seeing high rises, schools and hospitals I built? I even worked on the biggest project in the United States at the time, the Tom Bradley terminal at LAX. I helped put in the first piece of exterior glass there, and I'm very proud of that!\n\nLast year, I tested in the Local 12 Operating Engineers Union. I'm now an Inspector, 47 years old and an apprentice. I go to school a lot, and there are mandatory Union meetings, but I'm starting off at $37 + benefits, with a pension AND annuity for retirement. \n\nYou are never too old. Welders make a LOT of money, and in L.A. if you are L.A. City Certified as a welder, you will be working as much as you want for the rest of your life. This certification, the strictest in the nation, will let you work anywhere in the United States, as most jurisdictions recognize it as much better than their own.\n\nLocal community colleges have welding programs, nights and weekends. If you don't get in a Union right away, they will give you credit for any relevant education you took on yourself.\n\nFor anyone just starting, I would recommend finding the local union closest to you, in the trade you are interested in, and talking to someone in person. Ask for the business agent. People want to see a name to a face. Trades are hurting for skilled workers and are actively recruiting.\n\nBiden's infrastructure plan for the nation is pouring TRILLIONS of dollars in the local economies. Just in my area, there is work expected to last for the next 25 years.\n\nAnd, a lot of cities are charter cities, meaning that by their charter they must invest a certain amount of money every year in infrastructure. \n\nBeing in a trade is such a rewarding experience, and a genuine career. If you get in, you'll be making more than a lot college graduates, with a free education. And if you have a strong union, they will fight for you and make sure you have a living wage with safe working conditions. \n\nIf you get in, as an Apprentice, I would recommend you show up 30 minutes early to every job, have a great attitude and be eager to learn. People with good attitudes are always working. Being funny is a bonus! Have a thick skin, as you'll probably get ribbed on a lot. In my experience, Journeyman who tease you are signaling that they like you!\n\nAlso, trades don't care if you don't have a college education, have a criminal record, or even lack any  experience. The trades are great because they give people a second chance to make an honest and living wage.\n\nAnd finally, in the last ten years I have seen more women in the trades than I have ever seen in my life. In my experience, women are some of the hardest working and smartest workers I have ever seen. There are people in the trades from all walks of life, and you'll make lifelong friends.\n\nWhatever trade you choose, just remember that you will gain a skill that will last you for the rest of your life. No one can take that away from you. I have stopped being a glazier, but I still occasionally get calls to go back to work on some big projects.\n\nI'm consider myself very lucky to be in the trades, and I'm still able to run my small family business. And to think, it was just because I read a random article in a newspaper!\n\nDM me with any questions, and good luck to you!\n\n*Edit: 👋 my first award! Thank you!",
      "  Good info brother. Local 150 operating engineer outta Chicago. Best decision I ever made. A lot of work out there for the next decade or more.",
      "    Right on brother! Glad you're working!",
      "  Where would one begin to look into the types of work that the infrastructure bill brought to my local area? I'm looking for a career pivot and it might be good to see what will be in demand in the future",
      "    I really don't know, but in my experience just calling your local congress person might lead to a lot of relevant information.\n\nAlso, maybe look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics website?",
      "I worked as a line cook in my early 20s and hated restaurant life. Escaped into landscaping and farted around doing remodeling, maintenance, glazing and plumbing trying to find my groove. Eventually became a commercial HVAC technician and I mostly love it. Other than plumbing, I liked every one of my blue collar jobs better than culinary.",
      "  Same. I’m an electrician now, fuck the restaurant industry.\n\nEven just having a schedule that is mostly daytime Monday to Friday was a huge advancement to my quality of  life.",
      "    100%. Other than the occasional on-call I work no nights and no weekends. In restaurants you work a bunch of nights and doubles every day on the weekends. That alone makes escaping restaurants worth it.",
      "    Having a schedule, full stop! Got so tired of \"can you cover my shift?\" or *ring ring* \"heeeeey, joe schmoe didn't come in and we've got all tables filled, can you come in?\"",
      "      Totally, your reward for being reliable is always covering shifts on your days off for people who are unreliable.",
      "Psysically its just as hard as being a chef. \n\nIts just different mucles. And instead of bad shoulders and elbows. You get bad knees and hips. \n\nIts a slower pace, compared to being a chef. But longer days. And its in all kind of weather and job site conditions. Some are good. Some are horrendous.\n\n\n\nJob security is the same.",
      "  Having worked in restaurants in the past, and now construction, longer days isn't always true. The chefs I worked with put in a ridiculous amount of hours. Easily 10 a day, 6 days a week. My entire crew (chippies), and all our subs (plumbers, sparkies, etc) work 40 hours a week.",
      "    What about your traveltime to different sites? \nAre they included in your “40 hours”?",
      "      At worst then for me, 5 hours travel time per week. Still a far cry from what I've seen chefs do, and that doesn't include their commute time either. My point still stands.",
      "        If you can get 5 hours per week of travel time. Then go for it! \n\nMost of us in here have more traveltime than 5 hours. Per week.\nRegardless of which country.",
      "  Longer days? I highly doubt it. I often worked 80+ hour weeks as a chef.",
      "    Well if you are that cocky about working 80 hours a week. Then by all means become a construction worker.\n\nThe first 1 or 2 hours and last 1 or 2 hours of your job. \n\nIs driving to and from the job sites. \nAnd you only get paid for those hours. If you land a jib with a very good company.",
      "      You'll never get paid a penny for your commute as a chef. I retired from that life 18 years ago. I work as a digital marketing specialist now, make a lot more money and have a life now.",
      "Isn’t a chef kinda blue collar anyway? Same shit, different site",
      "  Yeah a lot of the chefs I know are drug addict alcoholic degenerates just like us",
      "    Sister is a chef.  Can confirm.  They're just as fucked as we are.",
      "      I'm one of the rare Chef's that doesn't drink, smoke, or do drugs. Lol",
      "        Omg bro you're gonna kill it in the trades. Just show up and ask the right questions",
      "          For real. A hard working, sober, fluently speaking English person with people skills will go very far in construction industry in North America if you are willing to learn and put in some physical effort.",
      "        You're gonna have a hard time.  \n\nLmao but in all seriousness the trades are a great place to make a living.  My guys all make 75k/yr or better in an unregulated trade, by all account they're glorified laborers on paper.  You can find a good job on a good crew and learn how to do some cool shit.",
      "    Restaurant workers in general can have some of the longest and busiest hours in the entire workforce, as well. I’d also argue that it’s a thankless job because the public naturally expects to find food somewhere, so working at one is just a given expectation among most people.",
      "      Absolutely. I worked at a KFC as the cook when I was 17, that shit was hard work lmao I worked in a couple other kitchens as well and yeah I definitely tip my cap to anyone working in the restaurant business",
      "  Kinda depends on how you define chef. There’s culinary school trained executive chefs and there’s “your local restaurant needs a chef”. Not to discount the latter but there is a LOT of science involved in cooking when you go beyond the basic level.",
      "    Oh I hear ya. Same goes for every trade out there.",
      "Yah I was a cook in younger years and it translated well into construction. \n\nKeep in mind your earning potential will probably drop a bit initially before it picks back up with a few years experience. \n\n5 years in HVAC, plumbing, or electrical is an easy $50/hr though. \n\nGo for a licensed trade.",
      "The trades can be good work and a good living for a lot of people. But dude, you’re 26, you can’t plan out the rest of your life. Shit is going to come your way that you could never predict. You’re gonna go through so many things in the next 30 years. Life’s a fucking ride. Pick a direction and set a course, and roll with it. And if you get into the trades and fucking hate it, try something else. You’re young enough that you have time for 2-3 more careers.",
      "Being a woodworking enthusiast is the exact opposite of doing construction work.",
      "I’m pretty sure being a chef is still blue collar work.",
      "As a former chef turned tradesman I 1000% understand where your coming from! \n\nJOIN A FUCKING UNION!\n\nDo not listen to anyone who would have you believe otherwise.",
      "Gtfo out of the culinary industry asap.  Not worth it. Much better pay in construction .",
      "I was in culinary from 14-24. Ended as a sous chef, found out I had a kid in the way and got into the UA as a plumber in 2020. Made more money as a second year than my last job as a sous. Worked 60-70 hours in the kitchen down to 36 hours 4 days a week. Life is 1000x better.",
      "Job market heavily depends on your location and the kind of development and growth expected. Every trade will have a different level of demand as well. \n\nUnions are great in a lot of ways, but in some locations they don’t have the majority of the work and so it can be harder to find work. For instance, I’ve heard numbers as high as 80% of electrical work is non-union in my province. That leaves very little for union electricians.\n\nWork life balance is heavily dependent on the company you work for, union/non-union, labour laws in your region, and what trade you’re in.\n\nI will say that I get an immense sense of pride in the work I do. I love looking out at the end of each day and seeing the progress of a project. Specifically my own part in that, but overall it’s just cool to be a part of building the city you live in. The money is nice too, though I hate the hours I have to work to get that money, lol. But, as a foreman and operator, I’m making around 3x what I did as a retail general manager. Though the work is far more demanding and challenging.\n\nI think if you’re interested, just give it a shot. There are so many things to learn and skills that can help you in your everyday life. It’s worth a shot.",
      "All the projects I’ve been involved with after Covid have been awful. I wouldn’t recommend construction to anyone these days. \n \nA better question is what do you want to get out of it - cause you can work in a kitchen or work on a job site, your back is gonna hurt in 40-years either way. \n \nYou say you’re a head chef, that’s good. Have you considered looking at other restaurants, maybe see if you’re underpaid (I suspect you are), or if there are different opportunities available in the culinary industry. What’s driving this change - more money? More time off? \n\nAnother factor is location - construction varies across cities, and joining a union is great and all but they don’t all necessarily have room for new apprentices. Anyway, good luck. Construction can pay well but it’s not for everyone, and it can be draining. \n\nIf I were you, I’d take a good amount of time off before changing careers.",
      "So, at 28 I quit my soul crushing job in hotel sales with no backup plan (it was that bad). To pay the bills I started doing work as a handyman, with almost no experience except the work I'd done on my own house. That led me to a job with a contractor doing home renovations. Did that for about a year. During that time I taught myself to draw in AutoCAD. After that year I got an entry level job doing structural detailing for an architectural firm. That eventually turned into site design, like erosion control plans and stormwater design. Now I am one year away from taking the engineering exam on an \"apprenticeship\" route, which puts me four years out from being a licensed civil engineer.\n\nNot that you should follow this exact path, just that if you hate what you're doing, construction is a very available way to get a fresh start. Pays like shit at first, but you'll find that if you show up five minutes early every day without a hangover and you don't disappear for a week as soon as you get your paycheck, I mean like if you are bare minimum a hardworking and reliable person, most guys will teach you what you need to know and tell you what you need to do. They don't need expert laborers they can't rely on, they need okay-ish laborers that are always going to show up and work hard and learn quickly. So yeah, if you're looking to make changes or even if you just need a stop-gap while you figure things out, in my opinion it's a really good option.",
      "U better get in now before all the college kids start applying that got laid off from their degree jobs that are gonna get replaced by AI",
      "First off there’s no such thing as an any time crisis. Just a little tangent but it’s relevant to what you’re saying. The way society has changed these days they want 14 year old kids deciding what they’re going to do for the rest of their lives. As a result people who later in life make a radical change in career or profession are looked at differently. It’s all bullshit. You could be 75 and decide to go and be a fuckin race car driver who gives a flying fuck? It’s your life live it the way you damn well please!\n\nAnyway that said, I’d recommend if you’re actually interested in any kind of trade get yourself set with the end in mind. Namely you want to be an owner operator over being a worker. Majority of the blue collar world these days are basically indentured servants to the multi millionaires they work for. You really don’t want to be in that position. What you can do however is leverage the current shortage of qualified people in the trades to get those same millionaires to pay for your training and tools to the best extent you can, and plot your escape the whole way. Open an LLC start putting ads out, tell everyone you know that you’re offering your services. \n\nJust my .02, I spent 24 years in construction and I honestly wouldn’t recommend the industry to anyone these days. Money has become the only factor anyone seems to focus on, quality, standing behind the work, giving genuine craft to people, these things are dying with a scattershot of specific exceptions. The only way I’d endorse it to someone is if you take this path with the intended end being owning your own operation. It might take a few years to get there but it’s better than killing yourself for mediocre money, some asshole gets rich literally at the cost of your body and mind. If you’re going to do it, make yourself the asshole who’s getting rich, and you MIGHT be able to actually retire some day 😂",
      "I worked in kitchens for years before working in construction. The type of people those two industries attract are very similar!",
      "i was a chef, started when i was a kid. owned my own restaurant and catering hall for 10 years, everything was pretty good until covid. we survived but it was basically like starting over, working  16-18 hour days again. decided to sell 3 years ago and became an arborist, best decision i ever made. my only regret is that i didn’t do it sooner (i’m in my 40s). the entire service industry needs a massive overhaul if it’s ever going to provide stable careers for people other than those at the very top. you should go for it.",
      "A chef skill set is a great skill set for construction. You are already used to hot stressful environments with a lot of noise, and more importantly the ability to plan, prep, and execute a specific process that needs to be well timed and well coordinated is huge. \n\nWatch out though, you may fuck around and end up in management and be back to wondering what else is out there that has less stress, less hours, etc. rinse and repeat.",
      "You could go down the route of being a trades person. Depending on what you like to do: electrician, plumbing, carpenter, concrete...etc. any type of commercial trade work will take its toll on your body as you get older (been flooring for over 15 years and have paid for it lol).\n\nYou could also look at Construction Management or even a Civil Engineering Tech type program. 2-4 years and you come out with a diploma or degree. Starting out you'll still be in the field but it'll be much more agreeable; surveyors helper holding a prism, coring out samples of soils for a geotech, testing concrete..etc \n\nIf you come from a physical trade, that's nothing compared to breaking your back all day working commercial construction. Then eventually, you'll do less field work and more office work. Go down the PMP route and manage multiple projects. \n\nLots of opportunities, just depends on where you see yourself in 10-20 years.",
      "Kitchen and blue collar transfers because odds are you work faster and have an attention to detail on repetitive tasks. The learning curve is the trade itsself. Worked in kitchens for 9 years and switched to welding. That’s what I learned when I look around now. I’m a lot faster and work a lot harder than most people.",
      "Construction is great if you have the self control to take care of your body.",
      "Have you thought of going into the healthcare side of being a chef. Much less stressful",
      "  I'm actually a Chef at a hospital right now. I don't work in restaurants. Should've specified that",
      "Skilled trades are the way to go. Infrastructure will be the focus over the next two decades. You can break into ok the trades rather easy. I would suggest visiting the OSHA website and getting certs to get started. Always keep a clean DL and always get more certs. OSHA 30 would be a good start.",
      "It's a trap don't do it your body will thank you",
      "First order of business. Make sure you are registered for the selective service (draft). You have until you are 26, then it's too late. Reason I say this is there are a ton of trade schools you might look into and a decent one can offer Federal financial aid, including grants. You must be registered with the selective service in order to be eligible",
      "I just turned 41 and switched to trades from 15 years of online advertising. Best decision I ever made. I will say I'm always sore somewhere. Lots of folks with different strokes. Unless the world ends, work will always be there.",
      "One big difference is the tremendous variability of working conditions. Outside of off-site catering, in culinary your workplace stays the same and you can adapt to it, and it to you.\n\nOne thing you have to be willing to get used to in construction is that the workplace just is whatever it is. You must adapt to it every time. And we're all in it together. So nobody is interested in hearing complaints about travel distance, parking, the disgusting chemical toilets, mud, heat, ice, etc. And if you must complain then you must do it with wit and humor.",
      "You like working hard and waking up early? If so for sure do it. I make my job work for me, I get to help people every single day and get paid to do it. Is it almost always gross or difficult work? Yeah, but its still gotta be done right by somebody. Job security is crazy too you can find work anywhere you can even get cash jobs from fb or Craigslist for extra money. It is very rewarding but very difficult on the body, gotta work hard enough while you're young to get yourself to a easy supervisory position by the time your body starts giving out.",
      "Lot's of people here who bailed out of restaurants.  I did 10 years in restaurants. Started in Construction at 24. Went back to kitchens once when things got rough.\n\nHere I am 39 years later. I own a Timber frame construction company and build monuments to my existence.\n\nI'm still a good cook too. :)",
      "it would be very easy for you to become a meat cutter, make a bit more, union. but trades like electrician pay even more than that",
      "Blue collar is the way to go as long as you join a union. Without representation and a say in your wages, hours, and working conditions, you will be exploited",
      "Chef to Steamfitter, here",
      "I'm a plumber. Your background as a chef, while it might not be evident or obvious to you (or maybe you know) probably means you'll do well in plumbing from a mental and physical standpoint as well as workload.\n\nYou said you make $26/hour, is that your cap? If I were to tell you for the next 5 years, you're going to be making $25/hour, would that upset you? So inevitably changing careers to go into plumbing means you're going to be making less than you are right now however you will make more each year, averaging $25/hour for the next 5 years and then after that, it's substantially more. \n\nThere is no shortage of work, and once you have skills, you'll never be unemployed, even if you got fired you'll find a job tomorrow. This is one reason I became a plumber, job security dictated by my skills and knowledge and what I can produce. I can do side jobs too, often making more than I make in a day within a few hours on my spare time because at some point, everyone needs a plumber. Gotta understand that plumbing has an expiration date, like at some point things need to be fixed and replaced or they will leak or fail, and that could be 25 years or 50 years, or sometimes people just want new stuff but are too afraid to tackle on these projects and rightfully so that they should be afraid because failure can be catastrophic. Homes are getting older, population is getting bigger, new homes are being constructed, less young people are getting into the trades. Your age is irrelevant when you consider how much money and how busy you'll be for the rest of your life. \n\nAlso, just by being a plumber, call me a safety net, my children are guaranteed to make $100k+ at some point in their life if they ever decide to follow in my footsteps and I'm literally their walking/talking college at zero cost. You know the saying give a man a fish vs teach a man to fish. This is personal, but I believe my duty is to help and ensure the next generation is set up to know how to fish, plus I love teaching.",
      "I was a chef also and made the jump into commercial plumbing at 28. It’s worth it, but make sure you go with the union. I make the most I’ve ever made in my life, have weekends off, work a fixed schedule, full benefits, retirement portfolio that the companies pay into 100%, a pension, and all major holidays off. I’m not going to lie to you and say that everyday is going to be a walk in the park, the work is sometimes tough, some of your coworkers will be assholes, but that’s not everyday. DM if you have any questions I’d be glad to answer them.",
      "Yes! Get dem skills boi. It's never too late to start in the trades. Plus, I feel like having food service experience in this industry gives one a kind of congenial-under-pressure edge.",
      "My son was a chef and decided to go blue collar because of the hours, low pay, and no substantive benefits. He is now a union painter and making close to three time the money he made as a chef and has awesome benefits. He switched five years ago and had to do an apprenticeship to get where he is today.",

      "I went from being line cook to being a machinist to being an engineer. You can do whatever you want if you put in some effort and don’t let people tell you it’s impossible.",
      "It's a way. Not sure I'd say it's the way.",
      "I did my trade schooling and apprenticeship alongside a guy who was your age, red seal chef, and head chef of a steak house. He took a pay cut to start, made it back in a year, made up for lost wages the next. His hours are better, way less stress, and always said he only regretted not doing it sooner.",
      "I made the jump from restaurants and bars to an entry level electrical helper position when I was 24. 10+ years later, I’m a master electrician and am a full time instructor that gets to work mostly remote. My company paid for my apprenticeship and all the required materials. It was a long and challenging road to get to where I’m at. There were many times I thought: “this shit ain’t for me, I’m out” but gave it one more day. Knowing now where it would take me, I would pick the same path in a heartbeat.",

      "Been in for 10 years and in my experience (I’m sure it varies) it’s more of a lifestyle than a job. Not much in the way of work life balance. All work and no play, been to 3 companies and currently self employed. It’s hustle bustle, always gotta meet milestones to rest. Can’t just take off when shift ends and you got half the trusses up or something. It’s like you’re always running a marathon and trying to make a good time, then as soon as it’s done you start another one.",
      "Trades, more work than you could handle",
      "Hey dude. You should look into getting your CDL and working for the kind of company that delivers the food to your restaurant. \nHome daily. Honest physical labor. Depending on where you're at, I'd bet you'd clear 60-80k in your first year.",

      "I made the switch from kitchens to commercial plumbing. One of the best decisions of my life. I have great benefits. Gives me time for my kids and the nightmares from the order printer have gone away. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.",
      "Same path as you, chef until 26, then I went into sales for 5 years, then finally moved back up north and got a Union job as a highway laborer, I would recomend looking into your local Union. It can be hard to get in but it’s so worth it. I’m the lowest paid trade in my area and making more than I ever made as a chef with amazing healthcare, an annuity and a pension. I went with laborer because it was low barrier to entry and I have a child. The UA (plumbers, pipe fitters, and sprinklers) is one of the strongest and best paid unions in my area. If you can get in there do it. The hardest part for me was going from a job where I was totally confident in my abilities to a job where I struggled both physically and mentally to perform the work. It gets easier every day, and I do not regret leaving culinary, tho I do miss it at times.",
      "I went from the kitchen to landscaping 5 years ago, around the age of 30. Very recently moved to the construction division, at the company I work for. There was some hard times and adjustments, but I would not change the world for it, and fully recommend it! It helped me in more ways than I expected!",
      "I went from line cook to HVAC. In my opinion, our order of operations as line cooks really help out in the trade, that and it’s hard fucking work. You’re still you f and can definitely still eat into a trade. If you ever get an itch h to want to go back into the kitchen, just go stage for an hour or get a PT job when season is slow.",
      "Do it , bring lunch show up everyday and don't be late won't be long till you know if its for you or not",
      "It’s not to late if you have a genuine interest in the trades.  But my experience from having worked in both the food industry and the trades is that they’re very similar.  You’re taking a passion (food, building) and experiencing all the peripherals.  Assuming you got into food service because you have a passion for it: I’d seriously not discredit your experience and also your passion.  Maybe you’re burnt out because you’re not being challenged.  There’s career opportunities that you can do that don’t require you to work the line.  If I were you I’d first look at ways to leverage your skill set in a new way.  Because while I completely understand the allure of changing jobs and doing something new, at least for myself I found that leveraging my skills ended up bringing me the peace I was looking for.  One last note: do whatever makes you happy and realize work shouldn’t be the only source of that.  If you want to build you can do that now.  Go learn and have fun and try out new things.",
      "  Yeah that's the thing. I don't necessarily want to just throw away all my experience that I have in Culinary. I actually kind of want to look into getting an inspector job in kitchens. It's a bit of a risk just quitting my job and starting over from scratch in a completely new field with zero experience.",
      "I’m m in construction and my body hurts. Only 12 years left to go. I hope I can limp by.",
      "I've worked dish pit in a kitchen before I ever worked construction and IMO chefs work harder with more stress than 90% of trades.",
      "Just go for it man the future for restaurants is bleak.\nBut I’ve made that exact switch from food and beverage. I started laboring for a gc to get my feet wet and tool’d up and found I was interested in plumbing. Now I’m union plumber and significantly happier. Still bartend a shift randomly got special events or if the money is insane.",
      "I’m a cook and in the middle of an hvac program, did some work at my buddy’s company over the summer and I can tell you the trades are way better than the kitchen life, it’s not so fast paced and you take your time but don’t milk it ofc, it’s not easy work don’t get me wrong but imo way better than dealing with the bs that comes with the kitchens, depending where you’re located I think plumbing is a great choice.",
      "She does when I'm with her",
      "If you get in construction this could be your mid life crisis, not your quarter life lol",
      "I went from line cook to carpenter and have never been happier with my work. Ironically I made the change at 26.",

      "    When selecting a fan make sure you look at the box and check the CFM’s. Lower numbers move less air and higher numbers move more air. Nothing worse then buying and installing a nice looking fan and you get more air movement from a fart.",
      "If you're spinning the fan to push down air from the ceiling, it'll be great for getting the conditioned air to floor level. If you think you'll ever spin the fan to draw up air and distribute around the room, then rotate your duct register 180 deg. It's probably not going to inhibit the flow from the duct too much, but if it's drawing up, it will be sending some back pressure directly into the duct, so the conditioned air may not diffuse as efficiently.",

The people who take the time to teach you and want to see you grow outweigh all the other nonsense. \n\nAlso!

    "Title": "Is My Concrete Crew Bullshitting Me By Saying This Is \"Normal\"?",
    "Content": "I work as a project manager for a general contractor and have a degree in Engineering. I am quick to admit that my university education did not give me a lot of fundamental knowledge about construction and there is a lot of knowledge that can only be gained through first-hand experience and hard labour. However there are times when I feel like my foremen are straight up gaslighting me with all the bullshit excuses they come up for the quality of their work. Our concrete curb and sidewalk crew is going through a rough time in this labour market and I'm finding myself dealing with a lot more excuses these days. \n\nThe latest example is some concrete curb that was poured on my site a few weeks ago. This is a basic 150mm wide x 450mm tall concrete curb, poured in forms, no rebar, with a 60mm slump concrete. The result can be seen in the photos in the link below:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xvRjnew\n\nThese photos were taken 3 days after the concrete pour and the cracks have only gotten worse since then. Right away I criticized the amount of honeycomb and all of the cracks. To me they are clearly related because all of the cracks appear to originate in the void space of the honeycombs. My foremen shot back with the usual excuse that concrete always cracks, and it's not a big deal, it's just a curb. The crew didn't use a vibrator at all and when I meekly asked if this could have been avoided by using a vibrator he simply said \"no\". \n\nTo be honest, if we weren't working for the same company I would probably be quicker to call him out on his bullshit but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I mostly work with larger reinforced concrete structures where vibrators are always used, but I understand that it is not as essential when dealing with non-reinforced concrete curbs. Both sides of these curbs will be hidden by future sidewalk pours so the aesthetics aren't important but I feel like the cracks on top alone are bad enough to warrant a full replacement. What do you guys think? \n\nIs this \"acceptable\"?\n\nCan this be fixed with a bit of patching and grout injection?\n\nOr does this warrant a full replacement?",

It should call out what standards or specifications they are using on the project.\n\nI work for a municipality and we have standard specifications that have to be used for every project, only approved products with producers that have been certified by the state and meet minimum requirements. \n\nIf this is private work, good luck. Lol",
      "        This is a serious QA issue by the way. If you are delivering a new build, I'm making you redo that curb at punch list. Curbs actually aren't small potatoes at all and they are kind of part of the storm water management in a lot of cases",
      "    It might technically be better. Ive seen hundreds of flatwork pours without vibration though, and no issues.",
      "      Ya there are plenty of pours that are fine without but you should do it. It brings the air out thus making the concrete stronger and it brings the milk to the top thus making it easier and more consistent to finish.",
      "      The problem is the air trapped inside. \n\nThis curb for example will be frozen solid ten minutes after it gets cold, it will have a lot of expansion, contraction, and seepage. \n\nEven in moderate climates, the water will soak in and stay damp.",

I worked with guys who had been in the industry almost as long as I'd been alive and I'm supposed to boss them around? Yes, actually lol but it took some time to learn that. I KNEW, because I had an education, that I didn't have the real world experiences necessary to make many judgment calls. Add to that an industry that can be very confrontational (and I'm terrible with confrontation) I often relied *too much* on my subordinates to get the job done. \n\nThe problem is, they are paying OP to make those hard calls. OP knows and understands their responsibilities and is struggling to balance that with their awareness of their lack of knowledge. OP will learn. Both the trade and how to handle situations like this. Bosses like OP can be frustrating because you expect them to just make decisions but if they aren't used to that or second guess themselves it throws the whole system off.

Deep down inside I know that this is shit work, but I've been dealing with so much bullshit in my job lately that I feel like I'm getting dumber as time goes on. \n\nThe problem is that most of my experience is from dealing with structural concrete, working with a much more competent crew that would never make excuses for this type of work. Ironically, I find that curbs and sidewalks are more difficult to deal with because pedestrian logistics are a pain in the ass, and the concrete crews are absolute goons. \n\nI'm also dealing with incompetent designers, incompetent ready-mix suppliers, and a rushed schedule so it becomes a full circle blame game. I'm inflicted with so much self-doubt that I'm not sure what to believe anymore.",
      "    Don’t get down. This was shit work, and the fact that your foreman doubled down by saying it is normal puts the blame on them too, in my opinion. Is there a superintendent involved here? Sometimes my foremen didn’t know better or were trying to pull a fast one, but my superintendents were scrupulous. If a vendor sent out crap product and it passed my (engineer) initial QC check against specs and contract, I’d hear about it from my super (some told me I was fucking dumb/blind, some were better teachers and said I was fucking dumb/blind but explained to me what I had missed) so I could get the vendor to make it right. If install was crap, they’d handle figuring out how to make it work.\n\nSo I’d run this by your super, or a more experienced coworker to get their take on the work and how to handle the fix.

Are there things that the crew leaders know and have more experience with than me? Absolutely, and that’s when I listen to them and go with their input.

      "  One mechanic tried to charge me $7,000 to change a solenoid. Found out it was a mom a pop that was bought out by a cooperation but kept the same name. Down the road I got charged ~$150.\n\nI had to get other annoying work done, normally I fix shit myself.",

      "  And Gc as well.",
      "If I got cornered like that I’d leave too",
      "  As someone who does work in people's cars and houses, it never works out when you cut corners or do dishonest shit. I've heard some crazy stories and seen too many coworkers lose jobs over the dumbest shit. In short, if they did the right thing, it would be a totally different interview.",
      "  you wouldn't get cornered like that if you quoted a fair price.",
      "    Who decides what a fair price is and what is it based on relative to contracting?",
      "      Fair price would be determined by getting estimates from several places. Take the lowest and the highest and average the price out and you now have a baseline cost of the work. \n\nCertain variables do exist, such as quality of work, references, reviews, all that can be determined when looking at the estimates.",
      "        I’m glad this gets brought up. The issue is what one person sees as too expensive, another may not even blink at. Affordability is an aspect, we charge more than double than most of our competitors. In exchange we are on time, clean, timely in completion, safety oriented, and professional. We mark everything up, add profit, and give ourselves a margin.\n\nA fair price is what someone’s willing to pay, plain and simple. “Industry Standards” do not exist. Ferrari doesn’t make the best cars in the world but they sure as hell have some the most expensive. Same with Prada and other exclusive brands. They’re catering to a specific client.\n\nFor contractors:\nPrice is determined by taking in consideration EVERYTHING possible: market (where the business exists), economic conditions, quality, exclusivity, on staff expertise (engineers etc), organization overhead, city fees and taxes, transportation, inventory, delivery, OSHA compliance, ppe, documentation, attorneys, consultants, the cost of labor, union fees, etc etc etc et and come up with a total operating cost per annum.\n\nThen it all neatly gets subdivided into a daily, hourly, per employee cost. So let’s pretend a business needs $189/hr to operate with profit, and they can ask double that. If all the customers agree to pay that, then that’s the price. If people don’t pay that then you adjust. \n\nIf you sit around all day hoping customers will help you make a good and fair price for them, you’ll go out of business in days. You won’t survive because customers want free and fast. We aren’t slaves. So ya, the job may seem simple sometimes but often enough it’s the machine that gets the tech or worker there routinely and for decades or longer. For a business to survive it needs capital. Feast or famine, and most of the time it’s famine.",
      "          I agree with you. It's a business regardless, and some have higher operating costs than others. But when you say $189.00 a hour profit, but double that see if they bite and if they do, great is not what earns repeat business. \n\nFor example, I had a leak on my roof. I had an approximate idea of where the leak was coming from based on the water trails in the house. \n\nFirst company came by, went up the roof after being informed by me that it's toward the left side of the house. He confirmed that would be the approximate location. He told me that He would have to redo the entire left side of the roof. Quoted me 20K. Work involves 3 men, 1 day's work and etc etc etc. \n\nSecond company came by and said they would have to do the water test, 500.00 cost, and once the location is found he can quote me a price. I asked an approximate 10k to 20k he said. \n\nThird company, said, \"I think I know where it's coming from, I see that a seal is worn off on the one of your exhaust vents on the roof. Lend me a hose and I can confirm, and if that's the case 1,200.00, I also see some broken shingles, I'll replace those too\" \n\nGuess who I went with. To be honest redoing the seal on the exhaust vent on the roof, and replacing a few broken shingles and redoing the underlayment in that area in terms of material cost and labor is not 1200.00. They were making about 900.00 dollars easy. Took them about 1.5 hours. He even replaced a broken faucet on my front yard. He said the facet is a little rusty, he went to home depot picked up the part out of his own pocket as he was picking up some shingles and did all of it. He also did another water test after the work was done. All this was done by 2 men, 1.5 hours with a cost of 1200 cash. \n\nNext time a roof leak happens, or if I know a neighbor that has a roof problem, who do you think I'll refer them to? \n\nI am also a business owner, and  if I charged the man his family jewels every single time, word would spread fairly quickly. If I'm the service provider, I have to be competitive to stay in business. Staying competitive means  first and foremost being honest with the client. Being honest and being experienced helps quite a bit. You know your shit, you know how much to charge, and you determine a fair price because you know your business well enough to know what your competitors are charging. You also know your competitors are going to try and gouge so you definitely win brownie points., \n\nThis HVAC repair man on this video, took a person's lack of knowledge and tried to exploit it. If he was honest about the work, he would have made it big, he was on TV, his name plastered for the nation to see. He could have done a good thing, be honest and earn the business. That would have been showcased for everyone. His phone would have rang off the hook for him to work on people's homes. \n\nLost opportunity for sure, now nobody will ever contact the name on his van. So I guess the point I'm trying to make, and the moral of the story is, be honest and fair when quoting a price. What makes them come back to you is not the price after all it was your honesty, expertise, and professionalism.",

      "My logic is charge what you want to charge, but don't lie about the scope",
      "  Exactly. You can literally charge whatever for labor but parts should be legit. Be upfront about it too.",

Not necessarily that you learn how to do the repairs. Just knowing common issues can be detrimental.\n\nAnd, it gives you the option to DIY if you choose. But generally you're just much harder to screw over.\n\nProbably a half dozen books, covering home and car repair for everything, and people wouldn't have these problems.

When I held the switch down the heater fired. One of the boxes had fallen  and knocked the door open. I came up stairs and she said the heater was suddenly working. I told her she had to much stuff in the basement and it was a hazard having it that close to the heater.  I cleared the area as best as I could and gave her a bill for the minimum service call which was 165 bucks. She told me that her social security check came next week and could I wait? I told her I'd wait forever,  and asked her to recommend me to her friends and family. She told me that the last time a guy had come out he took one look at the mess and told her to replace the unit.

Sandwich the stringers with the nailers where possible.  The cross grain has more holding power for the fasteners and the continuous long grain is less likely to crack than the diagonal corners of the risers.   Sandwiching reduces stress on the stringer corners and can enable more uncut width in the stringers.  \n\nThis work best when the treads have adequate depth.",

The overhang is here\n\nThere is no overhang there lol, the tread is flush with the riser\n\nYou have the tread *depth* but there is no overhang\n\n>This method makes a more durable tread, and it would be easier to clean snow off of it.\n\nHow is it easier to clean snow off a tread that is going under and behind the face of the riser? Have you ever cleaned snow off of a step? I live in NJ and have many many times and that  jyst doesnt make sense....im also not understanding how its \"more durable\", youre weakening the most delicate part of the stringer when you do this, a top mounted tread is plenty durable, there is no need to do that\n\nAs far as the code goes you are saving the need for nosing overhang but you would already save that requirement because theyre open riser, if you need or want the extra depth just over hang it\n\nIm sorry but this makes no sense to me....i get that there are a lot of different ways to do things but that doesnt make this way superior or better in any way, its just stupid imo",
      "      There are no risers on these steps. These steps have stringers and treads, no risers. \n\n\nIf you draw a straight line up from the back of the tread it will hit the underside of the tread above. All material in front of that point overhangs the tread below, thus it has an overhang, but not nosing. It is more durable because the overhang is fully supported by the stringer, with no unsupported nosing that could snap off. And I don't think a stringer is less strong from a notch, so long as the notch is cut clean without overcuts. Considering this is a national park, these steps might see half a million trips a year. This project likely isn't about saving time or money, but more functionality, durability, and sustainability. The lumber is probably sourced from 500 yards away.\n\n\nAgain, there are no risers, it's just air, so you can push snow through the air space.",

    "Title": "ZIP Shills, it’s time to put up or shut up",
    "Content": "Alright all you matt risinger dick riders, you Steve “basic” Baczek slobberers, ZIP is a straight up scam for homeowners and I’m here to set the record straight on this. This is a long post for you lazy fucks but whatever, hopefully the juvenile swearing will keep you interested.\n\nI’m in the process of finishing up framing my first house with 2 inch ZIP on the entire exterior including the roof and my god this is a shit product (for homeowners). I’ve done some basic research on this snake oil ever since all the flop dick instagram “contractors” kept blowing their load over it and let me tell you why it’s shit. \n\nFirst, I’M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU IT DOESN’T WORK. Obviously it works. it keeps the water out, it keeps the house standing far as I can tell. What I’m here to tell you is it is an unholy rip off FOR HOMEOWNERS and only the general contractors making points off the sale and “building science” internet warriors are the ones pumping it. The shills on instagram are on Huber payroll and I’ve seen plenty of Redditors feeding from the trough as well.\n\nSo to inform you if you’re not a home builder or just don’t give a fuck, ZIP sheeting is literally just OSB with a WRB (weather resistant barrier) attached to it and, depending on what scam you purchase, it also has rigid insulation. That’s all it is. It is marketed as being faster to install (because you don’t have to put a different WRB like tyvek on afterwards), and the shills also love to talk about how the house is immediately dRiEd iN once the framers leave. \n\nLet’s deconstruct the bulllshit piecemeal: \n\n- It’s literally OSB. Every old man on the job site will swear up and down that OSB is garbage. I don’t necessarily agree in all circumstances, but most internet warriors will crap all over OSB but conveniently forget about that when it comes to ZIP. If you sheet your walls in OSB and exterior cladding was vinyl siding, a small child could literally run through the drywall to the outside of your home Kool-aid man style. This is not a legitimate complaint about zip, it’s just a comical expression illustrating the fact that this product is JUST OSB WITH GADGETS ATTACHED.\n\n- Time saver? absolutely fucking not. Everyone always laughs at shitty tyvek/typar taping jobs when, if you do it properly when you’re framing the house, you’d only have to tape near the interior and exterior corners of the walls. With ZIP you Gotta tape every cock sucking 4x8 sheet, then grab a two handed roller so you don’t mess with the pointless huber warranty.  I’m telling you right now, your framing crew is NOT SAVING TIME using this product, and they’re also not cutting you a fucking deal on it cause cutting it and inhaling the god damn insulation will make them charge you 30% more not less! Again, bad for the homeowner.\n\n- The WRB. Guess how we fastened the 2 inch zip boards to our studs? 3 1/4 strip nails obviously (full head nails, calm down). Zip says you gotta nail this stuff 6 inch on centre in their installation manual. That’s 48 penetrations through your weather and air barrier!!!! This has also been talked about endlessly on instagram etc where you see some contractors taking the actual piss and using liquid flash on every single nail through the zip sheets LOL. Huber has clarified that if you don’t sink the nails too far, then the WRB holds up. Seriously? Okay then guys whatever you say. No one is using galvanized nails to apply these products to a home. as every building scientist dweeb will tell you, water is going to get behind the cladding and rust the fuck out of the nails, and I’m pretty fucking sure it’s going to go into the nail hole and into the bloody OSB!\n\n- Most IMPORTANTLY:  the cost of this shit is comically insane. A 4x8 sheet of 7/16ths R6.6 zip where I’m at is $119.99 Canadian Monopoly money. A 4x8 sheet of 1/2inch OSB is 24.99. a 4x8 R7.5 piece of ridgid foam (BETTER THAN ZIP) is 27.99. Then you will have so much god damned money left over you could get an insanely good WRB from siga or something like Blueskin which is self adhering and will have ZERO penetrations. You could even buy plywood instead of OSB and still save money!\n\nFinally, the old DRIED IN nonsense. Let me lead you to an article by Mr. Risinger himself, written in 2013. https://www.jlconline.com/how-to/framing/drying-wet-framing_o Here he talks about how even kiln-dried lumber has too much moisture content! So guess what guys, doesn’t matter you zipped the whole place and taped it perfectly, you still gotta dry the house out after the fact.\n\nSo there you have it homeowners, you’re getting taken for a ride. Alright I’m out. \n\nPS. Mr. Risinger, if you read this, you are an excellent builder and I’m just targeting you cause you have a large following and people respect you. All in good fun. Happy building everyone.",

      "  His perspective comes from new construction and complete remodels--unrealistic for people with a single property, an hourly income, and a family. How the existing home has to be plumbed for ventilation is not an easy sell once one swallows how much resheathing, replumbing, reinsulating, ad nauseum would cost. Then we have to frame in this stupid duct run too? I plan on moving out of this place before breakeven!\n\nNow when I build a home from the foundations, I'll be using ZIP and some of the other Risinger faves, but indeed, the truth lies somewhere between the hard building science and streamlining the existing where it matters most.",
      "Let's go through your points one by one. \n\nOSB is very strong especially the structural 1 grade that Zip system is. I have never meet someone that Kool-Aid man through it. Take a look at the APA data on OSB https://www.apawood.org/designerscircle-structural-i . OSB is stronger than plywood in a lot of applications due to how the chips are orientated in the product.  I like the Zip OSB better than the commodity stuff. It seems to have a smaller chips and more glue. Either way should avoid getting them in standing water. But the same goes for plywood.\n\nFor me, it is a time saver. Whether you pre sheath&tape the walls or seath/tape after standing. I find taping the seam much fast then unrolling and stableing Tyvek. FYI I almost never see Tyvek installed correctly. Also won't blow off in the first strong wind. Zip when taped correctly makes a much better air barrier than stabled on the product. The Zip R stuff also saves labor if adding exterior insulation. 1 trip around the house vs 2 or more. Is it safe to cut? No worse than any other foam insulation. \n\nThe nailing is the same as any other shear or braced wall panel per the code book. The nails self-seal when not overdriven. You can't tell me the stables in Tyvek are any better. You should not be over-driving nails anyway since it weaken the panel whether you use zip or not. I see so many production framing crews with guns set to drive the nail halfway through the panel. Guess what when you do that it can not provide the shear strength to the building as designed. \n\nIt does cost more for sure. For me, it works out as a labor saver and makes sense. Locally a 4x8 panel cost with no insulation costs $17 more than commodity OSB. To get a comparable air barrier would need to use Blueskin or a fluid applied. Blue skin would cost about $27 a panel making zip the clear choice. \n\nZip does allow you to dry in right away. Which means all other trades can start. On most builds, I don't worry about humidity until drywall. But if building high end like Matt it makes sense to dry the wood more so nothing moves during finishes. Which you can not start drying everything out until you are drained in. So still a time saver. \n\nBy the way I am not a paid shill I just think you're wrong. I believe that the Zip system is a good way to build a building. But there are also many other good ways to do it.",

He is a salesman, his product knowledge is mediocre. Monopoly framing is good, it's been around well before he pushed it. Building to beat your climate is important.

Some products he has on the show make it feel more used car salesman than knowledgeable contractor, but over all, I thank him for his efforts and opportunities to raise the bar and explore new products. \n\nDudes that ignore building science and say \"good enough it meets code\" are the same D- grade school used car salesman stereotypes who do the bare minimum in life to skin the pockets of a client.

I build in WA where we get a lot of rain and while all the other regular OSB homes get soaked and swell, my walls get raised with a ready to go weather barrier. Framers tape the vertical seams before they raise the walls. \n\n3. As far as sheathing goes, it is a better product than commodity OSB. It is more dense and less susceptible to  swelling. \n\nIf I'm paying $11 more per sheet, cry me a river for $1000-2000 more on a 750k house.",
      "I’ve installed windows now on a few ZIP systems, and yes, it’s a huge pain from our perspective too. I agree that builders would be way better off applying their own WRB and using rigid insulation on the exterior, which actually performs better anyway according to most building science folk. Also zip tape/liquid flash is stupid expensive. Also I don’t want to pay 3x as much for a dumb ZIP J-roller.",
      "  Couldn’t disagree more. We install doors and windows in zip systems as well as remodel all types of envelopes. Properly executed the zip system seems incredibly resilient.  I can flash the entire sill and edges of the rough openings preventing any air gaps and easily determine if my guys have flashed properly over the nail fin. Training people to properly flash with wrap is a huge pain with a steeper curve and that assumes that the house wrap was properly applied to start. Remodels with wrap and rigid often rot when there are window leaks due to unit failure and I don’t see how the zip system can fail if used properly. That being said there is no accounting for the ability of these wood butchers to fuck some shit up. We see a lot of tape that isn’t rolled and it only adheres fully when rolled so that creates an opportunity for the builder to hold his framers to task.",

      "            To be an efficient framer requires a skillset not everyone has.  I can leave framers framing, and I can supervise 3 laborers putting up zip style sheathing/insulation. I need to teach 2 guys to put the panels up, and one to tape. easier skill sets that knowing proper framing. Overall they save me money rather than taking highly skilled framers off framing and having them insulate/sheath/tape. \n\nMy personal prefered method is actually OSB sheathing, Fiberglass Z grits on the exterior of sheathing, then bringing in a spray foam crew to spray the outside of the building with 4\" of closed cell, Then apply extier cladding as designed.   \n  \nA 4-inch thick layer of closed cell spray foam would have an R-value of  approximately 26 + 15 for the 4\" batt on the inside, no bridging and a wall R value of 41ish.

      "I’m not a contractor but have worked as a foreman(plumbing) so I know a little bit about working with gcs. Have they provided a rough schedule? Usually they try and get the painter in and out since no one can/should work in freshly sprayed rooms. Make sure to have your contract stipulate conditions of the room before coming on site as they will usually be dirty as shit and you’ll have to wait a couple hours or bounce around as they get material out. In my area they require someone with an osha 30 safety card on site (generally the foreman) and some other insurance and safety information. Being you are subcontracting you are going to need to check if your subcontractors have these safety requirements in check or require someone with you have one being on site. You’ll have to incorporate that into your bid. To me it sounds like you will have a lot of paperwork you are typically not used to doing ahead. Make sure to have overhead-general conditions allotment in your bid. There’s a lot more to it all but I’m not sure of Canadian requirements verse US.",

      "Sounds like the GC is doing their project buyout and getting bid numbers, and they want your bid numbers in two weeks so they can compare with the other bids they received. From my experience, GCs and their Owner counterparts, are looking for a competitive price but most importantly quality / speed to meet the designated schedule.\n\nMake sure you understand everything they are asking via the bid-package, and carefully read the document drawings / paint specification etc., and if there are any discrepancy or questions always ask. Be sure to understand what they are requiring both from your office and field teams. Commonly, the GC provides a section of trade specific scope of work in addition to general boiler plate contract requirements,  and will list out what they are looking for  (eg. 1. paint without any sags or skips, 2. sprayed and also back rolled, 3. any mock ups required or paint draw downs, etc. just to name some examples). This list along with the drawings will be used in the field where the superintendent will implement and refer back to if there are field issues.\n\nDoes this GC have a boiler plate document they want you to submit your bid in or are they using any cloud software like Procore to have bidders submit? \n\nWhen in doubt about anything, never hurts to ask. The GC office staff (project manager, assistant PM, and project engineer) is there to help you. If you get the project your success is their success.  Any plan drawing / spec question will be created as a (\"Pre-RFI\") since the project hasn't started for this scope, and will be incorporated in the next set of drawings as addendum or bulletin version X. They may ask you to price out via the RFI or just wait until afterwards if you get the job as a change order to the next drawing version."

In some, the plan reviewers are classic local government employees counting the days to retirement.  I just about guarantee you that (unless they happen to come from a construction background), the plan reviewer's boss (likely the county administer) has no clue what an R value even is or why there's a code for it.

      "Years back I asked the big boss to borrow a little mini back hoe that was in a shed way back in the yard, almost never got used. He was all good with it so I took it to my house and was doing some drainage and grading work. \n\nGot called to come to the office on Friday and my supervisor shitcanned me. Went through my tool bags with a fine tooth comb and took a half a tub of flux, half a roll of solder, and all my fitting brushes and shit, anything they had bought before he would sign off on my tool sheet and give me my last check. \n\nNobody said shit about the mini hoe.

I was in the pit setting up the crusher when the owner of the pit came around. I asked him about the dozer in the weeds, and he said it's your guy's been here since that last time you crushed here. Apparently, he'd called a couple of times, but no one ever came to get it.\n\n The same company used to make me justify when I'd restock my service truck.

I put in my notice after six months on a very dangerous resi site an hour from my house to take a job with a contractor, Contractor B, with a good safety record on an industrial site four miles from my house. Contractor A asked me to reconsider, and I told them what they'd have to beat to keep me knowing full well they wouldn't. When I told the owner he replied with, \"Fuck you\". I told him I'm just going where the money is. He walked off angrily. A few hours later he came and just walked me off site saying in a mimicking voice the entire time, \"I'm just going where the money is.\" I didn't think too much of it. I called Contractor B, told them what was up, and asked if I could start earlier. They said yes, but I had to wait until the next Monday because that was the day they did the new employee orientation everyone needed to take. This was a Wednesday, so I was little bummed out to be losing that money, but I decided to get some coffee on the way home, read my book, and enjoy my 4.5 day weekend. \n\n\nMonday rolls around, and I'm in the orientation with a new PM who had just quit a contractor, Contractor C, in the area. I got to know him and chat with him periodically over the next month. Around that time we had a HUGE influx of guys from Contractor C join the company. I asked that PM why do many guys were jumping ship, and he told me they had gone out of business which is why he had to find a new job. They decided to sell the company to Contractor A. They excited to finish up three jobs and have about thirty new guys. What they didn't know is that the owner of Contractor C didn't have the money to pay his guys for the time worked leading up to the sale, told that PM, and then were told by him that he needed to go to each job and let the crew know or that he would himself. He did that but had the audacity to ask people to keep working. No one did, and all but three jumped ship completely which meant Contractor A now had three jobs to finish without enough guys. I got to know some of the new guys and asked about it. They all admitted to stealing everything they could get their hands on to cover their checks. One guy even stole a Triple Nickel I'm told. So now did Contractor A have three jobs to finish with three guys, but they had most of the shit stolen or so I thought. Come to find out that Contactor C owed the IRS money and they came and seized every piece of equipment that was left. Now Contractor A had paid money to take over three jobs, only get three guys, and get no tools. Hearing about it was music to my ears. ",

That sentiment is shared among a lot of other trades workers that I've met. 2012 saw a massive cut in almost every single trades worker's pay, and wages \\*still\\* haven't met parity with where they were for most trades, yet cost of living has skyrocketed since then.

Or if they were justifying it to help cover their bills to provide for themselves or their family. \n\nBut yeah if its someone who's biting the hand that feeds them, or steals from their brothers and sisters in labor, that's a low down move.

      "This isn't really tool theft but it's material allocation. I used to do commercial and industrial electrical. We weren't really allowed to save scrap copper because I guess people would fight over it. Any time we were pulling main feeds for a building there was always a lot of left over scrap though and we would smuggle it out. At one point I decided I was going to xray school and I was working on a pretty tight crew and the Super allowed me to save scrap to fund my school. Other guys on the crew started saving scrap for me as well. I'd get five gallon buckets of wire at a time from the guys. Sometimes bare but most of the time THHN with insulation on it. \n\nAt one point I was working on a large condo project with another crew and another Super and all of the Romex for the temporary power was pulled out and placed on pallets in the parking garage. It sat there for several months. I was surprised no one ever grabbed it. The job site was locked up at night but all day every that Romex was out in the open and no one grabbed it. Near the end of the job when I was doing punch list work and was one of the last electricians on the job I asked the super about the Romex. I asked if I could grab it \"for my school\" and he just said \"don't let anyone see you get it.\" This was enough Romex for temporary power for three large 18 story buildings. It was quite a lot. I ended up piling this Romex and the other wire on my back porch at home. I spent nearly a year stripping all of the Romex and scrap I could. I got pretty handy with a box cutter doing that. Eventually I loaded up my old F150 bed with five gallon buckets full of copper. I cashed it in when copper was at its peak at nearly $4 a lb. This was around 15y ago. I think I got somewhere between $8-10k for all that scrap. This was all scrap accumulated from multiple jobs over a couple of years I had no clue who contributed what so there really wouldn't have been any way to share the wealth and by that point anyone I was close with were all split up working in different areas. Between saving money from government scale pay and the scrap I didn't have to work my first two years of college. It really did help me change my life for the better.",

      "We (Deep Drainage Gang) were digging a rising mains pumping chamber.\n\nEffluent (dirty water) would gravity drain into it, then get pumped uphill to join the existing combined sewer system.\n\nIn essence it was basically a manhole with a pump that could be raised or lowered on steel pipes that went from the base to the lid.\n\nI was top man, responsible for doing all the upside stuff. Fetching pipes, shingle sand etc. We had a 21t longreach Hitachi and a driver. Irish guy, best machine driver I've ever seen and I've employed him numerous times as my career escalated. And a man named Dennis from Co Cork in Ireland. Dennis was the pipe layer, the man in the trench.\n\nDennis was 65. 5foot 6 in height and probably 5ft 6 around the waist. When we did the \"confined spaces\" tickets, Dennis couldn't fit the access panel in the chamber. Literally is as wide as is tall. But hugely experienced. Knew his trade inside out.\n\nWe were down about 8m. Excavation was fine, shored up with sheet piles and rams, built the wet well, back filled. Everything is good. Put the biscuit on, fitters fit the rails for the pump, pump is fitted with control box etc Everything is done.\n\nExcept we need to bench thr floor. Make the base smooth as butter, so particulates don't snag, rot and turn into dangerous gases.\n\nSlo Dennis puts on the harness, clips onto the tripod I've set up, which has a winch so I can winch him out if needs be and goes down. But he gets all tangled up in the pipes with the trailing rope as he moves around the base trying to get a mirror finish.\n\nSo he unhooks. \n\nBig site supervisor- main contractor, not my boss, my bosses boss, saunters along. Ahem excuse me, what's going on here?\n\nI give a broad description and explain that it was discussed at the 07.30 start right meeting. He's okay but obviously looking for an error. Sees Dennis is not connected to his ambilical. Immediately halts work, threatening all sorts and asks what would happen if Dennis succumbed to gases.\n\nI took 1 look, 8ish metres down, 1 look at Con the excavator driver and 1 look at the winch. And I said.\n\n\"You know Dennis, you know his size, and we both know that even that (pointing at the digger) would struggle to lift him out of this hole. The man's 30+ stone in weight. Connected or not, I'm not winching him up.\"\n\nCon almost fell out of the cab of the Hitachi. Dennis muffled some sort of indignation and Site Manager fucked off.\n\nWe still meet, and have a pint, and a reminisce and that moment is always mentioned. \n\nAnother one was when our black hat walked into the canteen at breakfast time and said \"Dennis your needed at job X\" and the traffic Marshall asked \"oh ok then, what times the low loader coming?\"\n\nI have never seen so many men laughing their asses off whilst trying to stop a fight.",

    "Content": "So I’ve been clean for about a month now and I’m being drug tested in about 2 weeks, I’ve read online that with how much you smoked could also be a depending factor on how long it stays in your system. I’ve been very on and off weed my whole life but from December 2023 up until August 2024 I smoked basically everyday for multiple times a day. There were definitely small breaks in between like a week or a couple days but nothing crazy. I’m just worried because I don’t know if it will come back positive or negative. I’ve looked into methods but it seems the only way is to wait it out. I still have to take at home tests to make sure I’m at least heading in the right direction but is there any tips on how to pass a test. I’ve heard of the fake piss, I’ve heard of certon or even drinking 0 sugar energy drinks right before. I know to piss in the cup mid stream. I’m thinking about going with the dilute method so that way if I’m re called back in to take the test I can at least have some more time to flush it out of my system. I didn’t know if I was going to be hired or not up until the end of July or else I would have quit sooner. I also know to sweat my balls off and drink cranberry juice and take vitamin b. I just want to make sure I have everything down. I could also be overreacting as I’ve met and heard of people being constant weed smokers for years and within a month they were clean. Like I said any tips or tricks could help. Fake piss is out of the question my job tests for creatin levels so that’s not possible with fake piss.\n\nUpdate: I took a test but I can’t even tell if it came out positive or negative. I’m assuming negative but it seems like I should be good by the time the test comes up. Thank you for the suggestions. I think just to play it safe I will be going raw and just piss in the cup but I have one test left so if I still feel uncertain dilution it will be. They’ll just call me and set a date for me to come back in and it will give me a little more time to fully make sure I’m clean. I will be posting a second update after I find out the results of my test. Wish me good luck I really need the job as it is union and I would be set for a very long time. To put into context, I’m under the age of 21 and by the time I’m 24-25 I’ve already been estimated to be doing 150k a year maybe even before those ages with the schooling and knowledge I know. I truly went down the right path. BLUE COLLAR FOR LIFE . Love all of y’all and let’s all get this money man. ",

      "So, from everything I’ve read about it. The length of time THC is detectable in your system depends on frequency of usage and body fat percentage. If you were a heavy user AND fat 4+ weeks isn’t out of the question for THC still showing up on a drug test.\n\nIf you were a heavy user and you’re skinny, you likely could pass in 3 weeks with zero problems. You said you’ve been clean for “about a month” now. So, that’s what? 3-4 weeks, and you’re being tested in 2 more weeks from today? If you legit haven’t had a single hit of anything like you’re saying for “about a month” and you’re not fat you shouldn’t have any problem pissing clean whatsoever.\n\nIf you’re concerned, I’d still just drink lots of water (gallon+) every day just to flush anything out more thoroughly, and take those at home tests a few days before your actual test just to see what they say.\n\nBut if it was me, and I knew I was going to be tested, and I hadn’t touched anything in 6 weeks I wouldn’t be worried.",
      "  Well since I haven’t smoked in 4 weeks I was already relatively skinny and since then I have also last 5 pounds, I between 145 and 150 and I consume at least a gallon of water everyday but that’s just a habit that I’ve had since I was young. I sweat like a mf as I’ve been a temp for this job for 6 months but it wasn’t until August that I stopped touching weed once I got the confirmation that I was being hired by the end of September",
      "    If you are so worried go to the local pharmacy and buy a $30 test, and test your piss, then you can walk in confidently and know you won’t fail!",
      "    By the sounds of that, you should have zero problem pissing clean in two weeks. Hell, you’d probably piss clean now.",
      "    Yeah dude, just like the rodbuster said, you'd probably pass right now. Take an at home test and I'm sure it will be clean.",
      "    You can get home test kits at Walmart, worth doing a check now to see if you pass. I was a heavy, heavy pothead, weighed more than you and passed after 4 weeks of not smoking. \n\nI’ve done the synthetic twice and while it worked it was incredibly stressful. Realistically not worth the legal trouble (if you are caught) as opposed to not getting the job. \n\nDon’t have your first piss of the day be at the test, drink plenty of water and if they claim you need to retest because it’s diluted that just gives you more time. You should be fine based off the info you’ve given",

      "  This. I literally went from working on weed farms where I would eat ungodly amounts of butter I made from kief …to passing a UA for a construction job after a month of quitting. Guaranteed you’ll pass in another couple weeks if you only smoked and aren’t 450 pounds",
      "  5'7 and a 120lbs and it has taken me upwards of 6 weeks to get clean and as short as 4 days for a lab piss test. Mouth swabs say they test up to like 30 days, but you could pass one the same day with a cough drop and mouthwash. You're almost guaranteed to pass after 48hrs",

May help with thc detection. \nAlso before the test , drink a bunch of water to dilute, take b12 for color, and some creatine for to add creatinine to your piss. Worked for me and it was a lab test.",

If big, cut your carbs, (less than 20 per day ,) immediately and go into ketosis, (burning fat for energy,) then right before your test, (3-4 days,) binge eat carb and fatty foods and drink a lot of water, either way, the idea is to put on some fresh fat and don’t exercise.",

Then drink just pure water for the last 3 days.  64 oz.  The morning of the test drink a 16 oz bottle of unsweetened tea.  You will pass.  My friend has a government job.

      "I had to do a pre-employment drug screen for a job once.  This was before my state became legal, and also before I found out the company didn't care about marijuana at all, just hard stuff.  Anyways, I found online the exact amount that Quest used for a sample.  I forget how much, but it turns out it is/was the same volume held by a \"bring your own\" travel shampoo bottle you can buy from CVS.  Had my friend who didn't smoke pee into it and carried that little bottle under my balls to the appointment.  Temperature checked out, and I just poured it into the specimen vial.  I was too nervous to use a product to help me pass, I really wanted that job but didn't have enough time to let my system flush naturally.",
      "Take your at home test now, and see if you're still positive. I wouldn't do mid-stream, so you get a good read on what's there. \n\nIf it shows up, buy 2-3 quarts of organic pure cranberry juice. Drink all of those (your shitter won't thank you) and test again. I'd be surprised if you weren't clean by then. \n\nIf you're worried, still, you know the mid stream tactic, pee once in the morning before you go in, and for 3-4 days before hand, eat really well and avoid exercise. Thc is fat soluable, so if you're losing fat, a small amount of thc might show up. \n\nThat's what I did when I had a legally mandated UA I had to pass. Smoked a small amount at a festival a week before the test, and I was barely clean before that.",
      "  I eat relatively well already, I eat fruits on a daily basis and it’s mostly protein in my body although I can’t lie 5 days out of the 7 so will go buy some food from a deli or go and buy food from a fast food chain but nothing crazy",
      "    That's awesome to hear. It's important to take care of yourself like that. I was more talking about eating excess calories for a few days(should have clarified). If your BMR is 2300 and you're working hard, try to eat like 3300 calories for a few days, so you're storing fat and not losing it.",
      "      I barely intake 2500 a day, eating 3300 would destroy me and take a toll on my body but if it means passing this test to be in the union fuck it",
      "        It depends on how much and how hard you're exercising/working. If you're maintaining your weight at 2500, then that range is fine. You just don't want to be in a deficit. \n\nPersonally, I'd just go to town on some ice cream for dessert.  Consider it a cheat week",
      "Last time I had to test I was very skinny, and a very heavy user. All day every day because it was covid and I was coming out of unemployed hibernation.\n\nI spent money on one of those cleansing kits and followed it to the letter, I flushed my system with water over and over and over again, I ran and tried sweating it out, all just trying to get a passing test. And I never got one until I passed 30 days and of not smoking and then I was good.\n\nEveryone is different but the 30 days thing is true\n\nEdit: I also took a fuck load of creatine and orange juice starting 2 days before my first real test and my test came back too watered down to get results and I had to test again, saved me actually because that test was at 28 days and I failed an at home test that morning and the second one was at 31 days and I was all good.",
      "  Well throughout my usage I have flacuated my weight a lot, I was around 180-190 back in December up until when I stopped using in August I was around 150 I’m now down to 145 and it’s been a month since I’ve smoked. I’ve drank shit tons of water but I think to ease my mind and how to move foward I’ll take a at home test tomorrow and from there I’ll see what I need to do. Granted I still have 1-2 more weeks until my test and from there it would be 5-6 weeks of me being clean",
      "    If you’re like me, then in my experience you should be good. The at home tests are a good idea",

They’re not going to run a secondary test for synthetics unless you’re getting a DOT job. \n\nThat’s a whole different enchilada.",
      "It took me nearly 2 months to piss clean. The Amazon strip that was posted by another user is the way to be sure. It's the same test most clinics use. \n\nSime tips other than just hydrate a lot: test as late in the day as possible. You will get the strongest results on any pee test as soon as you wake up. Don't worry too much. Worst that happens is you reschedule if the home test isn't coming up clean. Who knows, maybe your grandma just died and you have to go out of state for the funeral... whatever",
      "I use to have to take piss tests regularly. If you haven't smoked in a month and you got 2 weeks, that's more than good. Don't drink lots of water right before, because it will be obvious. I've had to retake tests because of this.",
      "Spend $50 or less buy a drug test from the pharmacy a day or two before your test use it and to find out if you should still be worried. \n\n Please don't be a idiot and buy something that needs to be sent in just get the instant at home test buy two take one a day or two before and the other the morning of if you're that worried. \n\n If you're still worried drink plenty of water with yellow food coloring in it clear urine is not something the diagnostics place wants to see.\n\n Between working construction and having a bunch of degenerate relatives this is their preferred method",
      "Buy fake piss, Monkey Whiz is legit and works.",

      "You passing the at home tests?",
      "Massive loads of cranberry juice and water.",
      "Just do it the same way people cheat with PEDs. So what you need to do is get someone your friends with who's clean to pee in a giant syringe the morning before you go in. Keep that on your body. Check the temperature of it before you go take the test, heat it up if you need to, when you go in the bathroom to take the drug test, just squirt it in there. If it's one of those tests where they are actively watching you you're going to have to be really really sneaky. They don't typically stare right at your dick but you would have to rig up something or some way with a tube down in your shorts where you could activate the syringe to squirt it in there \n\nIt's also worth noting that you're going to be able to dilute it somewhat by being extremely hydrated. So pound down a gallon of water before you go in. That's not going to save you if you're toxic but it might be enough to push you over the edge if you're close. \n\nI know all kinds of ways to cheat with PEDs but with street drugs it's a little bit different.",
      "Shit man, rule was for all of my budies on probation in high-school, two weeks. Always seemed to work out. \n\nKnowing what I know now, yeah your still fine as long as you are not massively overweight.\n\nGet an at-home test and see tho.",
      "I'm 5'7 and a 120lbs. It's taken me upwards of 6 weeks to get clean before. Drink water, exercise, and try to eat a lean diet. You can go to the dollar tree and buy a couple in-home marijuana test kits for cheap. Take one a week till you're clean. If you're taking a lab test, maybe give yourself another week after your pissing clean at home",

      "Fake piss at the smoke shop works every time",
      "Not reading that wall of text.\n\nMy best advice to do right now today, is to to to CVS and get a drug test. Take it and see what it says. If your negative, then you can stop worrying. If positive, start drinking lots of water, eat well leading up to your test and maybe sweat some too.",
      "I got a tip. Either stop doing drugs or stop agreeing to not do drugs. You and that man have an agreement. Don't break it. You wouldn't like it if he broke his end. \n\nIf you been clean a month, you'll be fine. Either quit the drugs or quit the job. He don't deserve you lying to him.",
      "  What I do on my personal time is my business. Never have I ever smoked or been high on the job and never will I be. It has never affected my career but I have taken that into consideration that maybe it’s best if I just completely stop and just switch to alcohol if I really do want to still you know have a  relaxing day.",
      "    It became that mans business the moment you agreed not to do it. \n\nIf you don't want him worried about you doing drugs off the clock then don't agree to it. It is not ok to fuck that man. You wouldn't like it if he bucked on your paycheck",
      "      He don’t give a fuckkkkk, he just wants me clean for the test lol. He himself comes in hungover all the time or sometimes half drunk on the job. But fuck it he’s good people but this is union so he can’t just let me slide",
      "        If he don't care then carry on. In my day you could bail water and pass. If you send prayers to Bob Marley, you must have friends who need to pass. I'd ask them. That kind of info really floated around in the circles when I was in them"

      "  This is the correct answer.  Also, in the hot case, it cools down at night so it might actually be good to have less insulation at times.  But in the cold case you need heat 24/7 for months at a time.",
      "    Up north go brrr",
      "  This is not correct.  While your statement is correct. But your premise is more of an illusion.  Delta T...nope UA delta T is just the beginning of Fourier.  But your actual energy usage across the year is heating degree hours and cooling degree hours.  X cost to maintain.   This plus latent heat value for removal of humidity.....\nIna any case according to DOE Midwest Central places like Minnesota have 6900 HDD and only 1050 CDD.  Vs southwest central including Texas average about only 2200 HDD and about 3000 CDD so 8,000 vs 5,000 for your mechanical system to correct for plus latent heat.  \n\nSo the difference in straight dry bulb heat and cooling only shows Texas 40% less than Minnesota.  If you include latent heat your even less different.",
      "    Minnesota has high humidity, so per CDD you're not getting as much difference as you think between MN and TX.\n\nAnd wind is a thing. When it's twenty below zero and blowing 40mph, with about zero humidity, your insulation and vapor barrier matters a lot more than when it's 20 in Texas for a day.",
      "      MN humidity does not compare to Gulf Coast humidity, lol. Just one example: right now in Houston it is 90%RH and 76F dew point. It’s like that about half the year in the morning. In Minneapolis it is raining right now and the humidity is only 72%RH. \n\nIn any case, high external humidity doesn’t affect insulation thickness, which is what OP was asking about. It does change which side of the wall you put the vapor barrier, and has some effect on HVAC.",

      "    You certainly can, but usually that risk is from being outside in direct sunlight and/or exercising/doing labor. It can still get hot enough to kill people indoors (and that will become more common over time), but cold is a much bigger killer in that scenario.\n\nThere are also a lot more days a year in northern climates where it's cold enough to kill someone without adequate heat than there are days in the south where it's hot enough to kill someone without adequate cooling.\n\nOlder people are most at risk of dying to either cause, and cold is a bigger threat to them while indoors. Add in the risk of pipes freezing, and insulation is more important in colder climates.",
      "    They have had uninsulated houses for years. True they would have a stove or heating system, but what they lacked was Plumbing. You can't have a cold house to where the pipes freeze. When there was no Plumbing they didn't care if the house got that cold. Most often multi-roomed houses only had one Heating source, so in the cold winter they slept in that room and not in the cold rooms. Unless you better you know had a lot of blankets.",

      "    Heat transfer is a matter of time, insulation, and temperature difference. The hottest areas on Earth where people normally live are only around 40° hotter than comfortable, while the coolest areas where people normally live are 100° colder than comfortable. So the amount of insulation you need to survive the cold, and the importance of that insulation to your survival, is significantly bigger.",

Our highs can reach 110+ in the summer but not usually for as long of stretches as the south might get.

This basement has no beams or anything on this side of the stairs, lol i just want to understand how this is possible.\n\nFirst home project where I need to call a pro, what would you all suggest? I don’t like this wall, and how it was slapped up against the stair railing, instead of taking that out and putting a normal wall up. Would a general construction company handle taking this wall down and building a new flush wall against the stairwell?\n\nThanks for any help.",

Is there anything else you've noticed like cracks in the walls or gaps under trim?\n\nIf you're concerned, spend a couple hundred bucks and have someone qualified to come have a look. You could call a structural engineering company, or a building company. You're not going to get a clear answer online, and the money spent will be a drop in the bucket of home ownership, and well worth the piece of mind.",

    "Content": "What do you guys think of the (new?) style of feeder mechanism for finish nailers? I bought a DeWalt straight 16 ga recently and the piece/part for feeding nails up and into the chamber is a thin piece of metal, no wider than the nails themselves. It tended to slip off and slide up, forcing me to slide it down again, to get the upward pressure to push a nail into the chamber. That, combined with shooting just air every 3rd or 4th shot, I returned it for a Metabo which has the metal chamber you might call it, which controls the nails left and right, and doesn't allow the piece pushing up to slip left or right, giving you constant pressure up on the nails. Hard to describe here, but I hadn't bought a new finish nailer in over 10 years, and was disappointed by this new style. Metabo has been great so far.",

      "There are no shims where the screws are. This is subpar work, and they really need to use some type of hard spacer. You can easily do it yourself if you're careful and don't overtighten anything, but shims are definitely necessary.\n\nIt looks like they used butyl tape, which is concerning because there are no pictures of the exterior to determine if this is an issue with the trim, the caulking, or if there is even any trim around the window at all. In any case, the light leakage is unacceptable. Pictures of the outside would be helpful in determining the issue at hand.\n\nAdditionally, there is no insulation around the window. You can use minimal expansion foam or pack it with fiberglass insulation; personally, I recommend minimal expansion foam.",

      "  How does that work?  I assume you need the material staged on site?  I’d also be skeptical.",
      "    Thats about all of the logistics they could explain, that they would have to keep material on site.  But otherwise they couldn't really break down the full logistics of it.  Just that \"1 machine can do at least 60 yd per hour, so 2 can handle 120\"  and I'm just like i don't think you fully understand the scope of what we're doing here.  Like we normally need a constant flow of trucks with dumping out around 3+ at a time to keep up with that.  Taking reloading the truck out of the equation i still don't think they could keep up.  But that's what the truck is rated for, so the salesman gonna say they can do it. \n\nI can see the appeal of it on small pours and residential and you only pay for what you use, but they just couldn't grasp that they were out of their zone with this.",
      "      Yes, you would need materials staged on site and a loader to refill materials. Example set-up for continuous pours with volumetric: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVlE-hlCrUk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVlE-hlCrUk)",
      "        Yeah, thats the obvious part.  On a tailgated slab like I was discussing with the guy, it would help to know how long it takes to unload, travel across the site to staging area, reload, travel back to pour location and be ready to discharge.  As i see it, At best with 2 trucks, one is unloading and one is reloading at any given time and you're just not going to give me the volume I need with only 2 trucks. I've had an on site plant struggle to keep up with 5-6, I just don't see how these cute volumetric trucks would be 3x more efficient.  I just don't think they had ever done it and just because their truck is rated for a certain output doesn't mean they actually can. \n\nAdditionally, how much material do they plan to store on site for a large pour like that?  How big of a staging area would they need?  How much space will the aggregate take up?  How much space will the sand take up?  How much cement can they store on site?  Do they plan to bring in overnight to restock?  All the stuff a ready mix supplier knows the answer to but these guys couldn't even begin to answer- only tell me that 2 trucks can keep up with 120 yd/hr no problem.  \n\nIn that video you posted, maybe im misunderstnading but 350 yards in 6.5 hours?  That's slow as shit.  Using 2 pumps to place it?  Unnecessary, and I'd never get a job if I double pumped anything.  Maybe different markets but any large slabs are tailgated around here. \n\nNot trying to shit all over the volumetric stuff, I just don't think it's the right application for everything.  If someone on here has done this I'd love to hear more in depth how this would work but the salesmen trying to tell me \"trust me bro it'll be ok\" just didn't give me that warm and fuzzy feeling that they had any experience with it or knew how to make it work.",
      "I think so. One application is remote locations without a nearby batch plant.",
      "Yes they are niche. They’re expensive for one and are inefficient with how concrete work is typically done."

Good functional fitness style gyms will teach you how to move your body correctly and help you with mobility before helping you build strength.

      "People are designed to hold each other back from succeeding through the evolutionary process. It has been ingrained in us that if we don't succeed at something and see others fail, we discourage others from attempting it. It was helpful for survival in a time when survival was a lot harder.\n\nMy favorite example is from a team of scientists that wanted to test this, so they held a group of monkeys in a room with a bundle of bananas at the top of a pole. Whenever a monkey would climb the pole to get bananas, a scientist would spray them in the face with water until they gave up. This happened every time a monkey climbed the pole until they started holding each other back and wouldn't let anyone climb this pole. Then the scientist started switching the monkeys out 1 by 1 until none of the original monkeys remained in the room, but they all still continued to hold each other back without even knowing why. None of the new monkeys knew what happened at the top of the pole. They just knew not to climb it and to continue holding each other back.\n\nDon't let people's negative comments have an effect on you, how you feel about yourself, or what you do with your day. We already have so little control over things in our lives. Self-control is the only real control we have, and when you let other people's poor attitude negatively affect how you feel, you surrender the last bit of control you have.",

I wish I bought a supply before they discontinued, but didn't realize before it was too late. \n\n~~~~~~\n\nThe most recent ones for me are these nutsetters:\n\nDeWalt DWA2222IR\nhttps://www.dewalt.com/product/dwa2222ir/impact-ready-cleanable-nut-drivers\n\n•  Cleanable nutsetter\n•  Deeper socket seems to have better grip on screw heads.  \n•  They replaced these with the removable socket-type, I'm sure due to ease of manufacturing, but they don't work AS well.  \n•  When I'm laying on my stomach hanging off the edge of a building putting in screws, or 60ft up in a boom lift, it's nice not having to worry about dropping the piece.  They still sell literally every other size, but it seems the world is out of 5/16.  I really miss this one.\n\n~~~~~~\n\nMakita B-35047 https://www.makitatools.com/products/details/B-35047\n\n•  Non-magnetic, ball-notch retaining 5/16 nutsetter\n•  Great for stainless screws\n•  All the other brands I've tried break pretty easily in an impact.  Or they just kind of suck to use.  \n\n~~~~~~\n\nJust in general, it's a pain in the ass to try to find any legitimate marker for the non-magnetic type.  I understand not selling them in a big box store, but why can't I get this stuff online at least.  Anyone have any that they like?\n\nAnyway, what are some of your most favorite tools that you wish you could still get your hands on? ",

The actual take home pay is accordingly lower than it seems.\n\nIt might be useful to get some experience using agency work through an umbrella company if you've just got your ticket - you're unlikely to show up and be turned away if an agency's sent you there knowing you're just qualified. Don't rely on umbrella, whether that's through an agency or with a GC/subby, they're a tax avoidance scheme for large companies that didn't want to directly employ people in a largely seasonal industry in the UK.",

Alteration activity also dipped again in August, although not as much in magnitude as new construction. For alterations, year-over-year growth remained positive at 1%."

      "    The strongest men in those competitions are all 300+ lbs and hold a high percentage of body fat. There are very few exceptions, who are champs that maintain bodybuilder-type physiques (low body fat)",
      "      And it's much healthier in the long run to have low body fat and taking steroids than spending years of your life at 400+ pounds on top of taking steroids. \n\n\n\n\nThe fact that they have higher body fat I genuinely believe likes being pointed out on Reddit to make fat guys who don't even lift or exercise (work ain't exercise) feel better about themselves. \n\n\n\n\nMass moves mass but if you can achieve that mass as muscle, rather than fat, you will be much better off. This is just extremely difficult at that size (height and pound for pound) ",
      "        I would bet the amount of steroids and gear that world's strongest man vs high level pro body builders take is not really comparable though. \n\n\nAlso the exercise that world's strongest men do probably somewhat mitages the extra fat damage vs dieting to the extra hurting your body's natural recovery mechanisms while injecting your body with the kitchen sink. Id still bet the world's strongest men competitors are healthier but if they start dying off like bodybuilders do I'd change my opinion.\n\n\nWork can be exercise depending on what your work is. I work in a warehouse and  depending what Im doing it's definitely exercise. ( I'm doing 30k+ steps some days.)\n\n\nI agree in general being at a health body fat percentage is better for your health though and people can use \"mass moves mass\" as an excuse to be fat.",

You're completely kidding yourself if you don't think everyone in these sports is on large amounts of gear, especially untested federations. Sports like arm wrestling have no testing. Everyone is on steroids. \n\n\n\n\nYes being 400 pounds and sedentary is worse then being 400 pounds of muscle and fat with PEDs. But your heart struggles either way when you're that massive.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking isn't exercise. It's not challenging enough to really do anything besides burn some calories unless you were previously sedentary or very overweight. But that's a very low bar. What I really meant was the work is not a workout. Simply moving around and doing things isn't a workout even if you get tired. \n\n\n\n\nI wouldn't even say they're using mass moves mass as an excuse lol.

My physique matters to me.\n\nDefinitely not the healthy choice we see in this picture. But this is indeed the archetype physique of the men who consistently win strongman competitions.",

I initially thought we were just trolling fat guys with this pic. I'm no expert on the athletes though, so yeah, there's likely more nuance to it.",
      "    It's easier to maintain huge amounts of muscle tissue if you can also keep large amounts of bodyfat. So powerlifters/strongmen competitors tend towards this type of body if there's no weight-limits on the competition. \n\n2% bodyfat + 200lbs of muscle is not optimal for an animal trying to survive in the wild. Muscle tissue is expensive metabolically.",

    "Title": "Florida Condo Reserve Study Requirements: What Condo Owners and Associations Need to Know",
    "Content": "In recent years, Florida has taken significant steps to improve the safety and financial security of condominium buildings, particularly in response to concerns about aging infrastructure. One of the critical elements of this reform is the **reserve study requirement** for condo associations. This mandate, part of a broader legislative effort, ensures that associations have sufficient funds set aside for major repairs and maintenance of key structural components. For condo owners and board members, understanding these new requirements is essential to avoid legal pitfalls and ensure the long-term sustainability of their buildings.\n\n**What is a Reserve Study?**\n\nA reserve study is a long-term financial planning tool used by condominium and homeowners associations to determine the amount of money that needs to be set aside in a reserve fund for future repairs and replacements. The study assesses the condition of major components and systems of a building, such as:\n\n* **Roofs**\n* **Exterior walls and painting**\n* **Elevators**\n* **Plumbing and electrical systems**\n* **Foundation and structural supports**\n* **Parking lots and garages**\n* **HVAC systems**\n\nBy calculating the remaining useful life of these components and estimating replacement costs, a reserve study provides a financial roadmap for how much money the association should collect from owners to cover future expenses.\n\n**Why Are Reserve Studies Now Required?**\n\nThe collapse of the Champlain Towers South in Surfside in 2021 highlighted the dangers of [deferred maintenance and inadequate financial](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/513/1/012028) planning in aging condominium buildings. In response, Florida lawmakers introduced stricter regulations in 2022 and 2023 to ensure the safety and structural integrity of condos statewide.\n\nThe new **Florida condo reserve study requirements** mandate that all condo associations conduct regular reserve studies and maintain adequate funds for major repairs. These laws are designed to prevent associations from deferring necessary repairs or relying on special assessments that place sudden financial burdens on unit owners.\n\n**Key Provisions of Florida's Reserve Study Requirement**\n\n1. **Mandatory Reserve Studies Every 10 Years** Under the new law, all condominium buildings in Florida must undergo a reserve study at least once every 10 years. The study must be conducted by a qualified, licensed professional, such as an engineer or architect, who is knowledgeable about building systems and long-term maintenance needs. This ensures that the study provides an accurate assessment of the building's future repair and replacement costs.\n2. **Full Funding of Reserves** One of the most significant changes is the requirement for full funding of reserves for certain components deemed \"critical\" to the structural integrity and safety of the building. Previously, many associations were allowed to waive or underfund reserves if approved by a majority of unit owners. The new law eliminates this option for key structural components, such as:\n   * Roofs\n   * Load-bearing walls\n   * Electrical systems\n   * Fire protection systems\n   * Foundations\n   * Plumbing\n   * Windows and doors\n\nCondo associations must now collect sufficient reserves to cover the estimated cost of future repairs and replacements for these critical components, ensuring that funds are available when needed.\n\n1. **No Waiver or Reduction of Reserves for Structural Components** Before the law was updated, condo owners could vote to waive or reduce reserve contributions, leading to insufficient funds for major repairs. The new [legislation prohibits](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00104/full) this practice for structural components and critical systems. Associations must now fund reserves in full, with no exceptions. This protects buildings from the risk of financial insolvency or the inability to make urgent repairs.\n2. **Transparency and Reporting** Condo associations are required to provide unit owners with detailed information about the reserve study, including the findings, recommendations, and the amounts that need to be collected for reserves. This transparency ensures that unit owners understand the financial obligations associated with maintaining the building and can hold the association accountable for proper financial management.\n\n**How Does the Reserve Study Process Work?**\n\nThe reserve study process typically involves several steps:\n\n1. **Site Inspection** A professional conducts a thorough inspection of the building's major components and systems. They assess the condition of each element, estimate its remaining useful life, and determine when repairs or replacements will be needed.\n2. **Cost Estimation** After the inspection, the professional calculates the estimated cost of repairing or replacing each component. These estimates take into account inflation and other factors that could affect future costs.\n3. **Reserve Funding Plan** The reserve study provides a funding plan that outlines how much the association should set aside each year to cover future expenses. This plan includes a schedule of recommended contributions to the reserve fund to ensure that money is available when needed.\n\n**Impact on Condo Owners and Associations**\n\nFor condo owners, the new reserve study requirements mean more predictable financial planning. While increased contributions to reserve funds may result in higher monthly association fees, it also reduces the likelihood of large special assessments or emergency repairs. Properly funded reserves also help maintain the property’s value, making the building more attractive to potential buyers.\n\nFor condo associations, the challenge will be ensuring compliance with the new requirements while managing the expectations of unit owners. Associations that have underfunded reserves in the past may need to increase fees or implement special assessments to bring their reserve funds up to the required levels. Clear [communication and transparency](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/08933189231153869) with unit owners will be key to managing this transition smoothly.\n\n**Consequences of Non-Compliance**\n\nFailing to comply with the new reserve study requirements can have serious consequences for condo associations. Non-compliance can lead to:\n\n* **Fines and Penalties** State regulators can impose fines on associations that fail to conduct reserve studies or maintain adequate reserve funds.\n* **Loss of Insurance** Some insurance companies may refuse to renew coverage for buildings that do not meet reserve funding requirements, leaving associations exposed to significant financial risks.\n* **Legal Liability** Condo boards may face legal action from unit owners if they fail to comply with the law, leading to potential lawsuits or removal of board members.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe new [Florida condo reserve study requirements](https://www.teamcomplete.com/home/structural-integrity-reserve-studies-sirs-2/) mark an important step toward ensuring the long-term safety and financial health of condominium buildings across the state. By mandating regular reserve studies and full funding for critical repairs, Florida lawmakers aim to prevent future tragedies and protect condo owners from unexpected financial burdens. For associations, compliance with these requirements is essential, not only to meet legal obligations but also to maintain the value and safety of their properties.",

Try again to really pull on the mount out from the wall to reapply force onto the board and slowly try unscrewing again. \n\nYour other option would be drill out the head of the bolt with a drill bit that’s larger than the bolt diameter or use a grinder with a cut off disc to cut the head off. ",

      "Fuck me im looking at that imperial tape measure brain ticking over trying to make sense of the measurement 😂",
      "Fun fact: there is no minimum safe distance in the standards for fall protection. The 6 foot number people throw around comes from the criteria for warning line systems in 29 CFR 1926.502(f). \n\nHowever, warning lines are not allowed in every application and are not allowed to be the only fall protection in place for roofing work. Depending on exactly what work you were doing, a fall protection plan using various methods can be in place, but in nearly every circumstance, the only options for fall protection are guard rails, safety nets, personal fall arrest or fall restraint: \n\n1926.501(b)(1)\nUnprotected sides and edges. Each employee on a walking/working surface (horizontal and vertical surface) with an unprotected side or edge which is 6 feet (1.8 m) or more above a lower level shall be protected from falling by the use of guardrail systems, safety net systems, or personal fall arrest systems.\n\nSo in this case the safety guy was right. Remember that these standards are the bare minimum and employers have the option to implement policies that are more strict. So if they tell you it’s 100% tie off on the roof, then it’s 100% tie off on the roof regardless of what’s in the regulation.",

I'm like ok can you prove I signed anything, like where is this document? She goes and grabs the document from their temp office and brings it out and its some dudes random name, and while they are all realizing the fuck up - the fucking habitual offender walks right passed us and they all realize now they got the wrong guy. This guy proceeds to get on his ladder with ZERO PPE on and start fiddling with the AC 20 ft up the wall. The safety lady goes \"hey wheres your PPE???\".

    "Content": "I recently enrolled at my nearby community college as a construction management major. However, I have been taking classes that aren't related to construction for my first semester. I'm really interested in this career path. I love seeing things be built, knowing how things work inside of them, fixing things, working with my hands, and doing the fulfilling work that construction does for me (My dad is a contractor, so I've worked for him before and I really enjoy it). However, I'm stuck between that and an electrical apprenticeship, which I am interested in because I want to learn that skill and also spend more time in the field learning from people who have been doing it for a long time, rather than jumping into a management role. My parents have been telling me to follow through with Construction Management, and I just started and haven't taken any classes that are construction based yet so I don't want to be to impatient and jump ships right away. But my gut is telling me to go to electrical apprenticeship, but I just want to know what you guys think and if you have any advice on what would be a better option. Making the most money isn't what I'm worried about mostly just doing something I will enjoy and that I am learning a lot in.",

      "Same here im enrolled in construction technology at my local community college. Our situations are pretty similar so I’d say just think about what u want in long term And take small steps at a time toward achieving it. If you’re really into construction management an electrical Forman or contractor sounds dope. And I’ll guess you’re pretty young like myself so keep moving forward we have a long journey ahead🙏",
      "  Definitely, I’m trying to look into each one and figure out which one lines up with my goals and values most, and definitely yea I’m 19 so I still have time to test the waters on them both, in no rush. Thank you, and best of luck to you in your path man!",
      "Currently working construction management. I would say do the apprenticeship and CM. You’d be surprised at how many certified engineers that you work with that were paper smart but not field smart. If you’ve done the work and later move to  overseeing it, it gives you a  better understanding and perspective then just reading/learning about it. No the ins and outs before managing them works better. But what do I know I’m just some guy on the line! lol",
      "  100% I definitely agree with that, I feel like being papers smart only is kind of like taking a short cut when I could just enjoy learning first and not try to take up a management role at a young age for no reason, I’d rather know the ins and outs before trying to manage them",
      "If you are going to college, go for an engineering degree. A CM degree pigeon holes you into the general contractor world.\n\nMy recommendation is to go the apprenticeship route. You have zero debt at the end and will be making more than most college graduates will in 10 years.",
      "  Thank you, yea I’m leaning towards the apprenticeship for that reason as well, it seems like the better option off my circumstance and wants from the career"

The worst thing the company consistently did to us was not decide location or size of rooftop hvac units that needed blocking for support until they got the HVAC contractor out to mark it after we already built the roof. On this companies jobs I had basically started just tacking on sheating so I could take it back off later because the top flange hangers they supplied needed to be nailed under the sheathing. There were other things as well like location of blocking for recessed paper towel dispensers in the bathrooms and deciding what sort of cap they want on the parapet walls etc as well. So I'm already not happy with the company and then the super has the audacity to berate me for not bringing this stuff up earlier because we need two week for rfis to go through. My response was I brought this shit up a month ago before we even set foot on the job and he told me that this is the first he's hearing of it.

One of my proudest moments was when the big bosses were discussing who should be put on a tough project and they agreed it should either be me (the youngest supt) or Perry (our oldest, most experienced supt).\n\nSome young supts are great.

In my opinion you shouldn’t have to earn respect in the workplace in order to not be disrespected. I think the older generations have a different opinion on it, in my experience anyway. Not trying to insult anyone, everyone is different.\n\nWhen I was 27 I had a similar experience. Ended up in a position I wasn’t fully aged in for and not entirely prepared for. It was extremely difficult and I cried in my closet a few times over the stress BUT…Give it a go man if he’s strong, hard working, and sociable he’ll probably be better off for it in a few years. \n\nSomething that really helped me deal with the guys who I could tell were going to be a pain in the ass, was to ask them questions about the job or problems, and make them feel like the solutions were their ideas. Most of the time it was already planned, but it showed that I had respect for their experience. At the end of the day the super takes the shit from the customer or has to take the fall. Another way to address the more difficult ones is to say “hey man..when this job inevitably goes sideways, are you going to be the one taking it up the ass from the customer or am I? Get the f*ck out of my face.” The second technique is a lil riskier but sometimes YOU GET A LITTLE STRESSED OUT THERE.\n\nSorry for the rant! Thought it might be helpful!",

Age doesn’t matter, you already described him as “Knowledgeable,sociable,hard working”.\n\nHe’s earned your respect clearly. What makes you think he won’t earn the sub contractors on the field? \n\nI’m 20, hitting 80k salary, and a Construction Manager.

Getting in the shit to help out and make everyones life easier makes the biggest difference. Then they treat me like a super. \n\nSometimes you get guys who will persist with their bullshit because they are just lazy bastards and are hoping to slide past with the bare minimum. That's kind of a different story though. Those guys are just scumbags. \n\nOnce in a while you will get a foreman who's been in it for 20 or 30 years who resents being told he needs to do a better job by a guy who looks 25. He's just sore he never grew beyond his own limitations. Stopped learning 20 years ago and is just clocking in and out till he can't anymore. That's when you hit him with the \"is that the best you can do?\" And then go show him how it's done. Don't do his job for him but make his lame excuses look like lame excuses. Just don't do it in front of other people. Humiliation doesn't help and doing it respectfully can knock some sense into a foreman who's just jaded with the job. Can't win over everyone though.",

That’s literally what a super is supposed to do, facilitate the work and ensure everyone has what they need to make their scope run smoothly. Every job is going to have one or a few disrespectful guys, don’t ever, ever take this shit personal.\n\nDo the job because it’s fun for you",

As long as humans beings are alive, we will all make mistakes. Recognizing and owning your own mistakes will gain you levels of respect that age cannot. As someone else said about a younger super, when you work circles around people and can use technology to ease your people’s suffering, then it’s a win all around.",
      "If they can help the subs get answers and provide value then they will get respect.",
      "The position has changed a ton over the years. When I started in the business late 90’s it was the super who ran the job. \n\nThese days the PM’s run the jobs, and by that I don’t really mean the pm as a person, but the money which typically they or someone on the white collar side has control over. \n\nIt didn’t use to be this way, the attitude with jobs was to get them done fast and correct. Now today? It’s all the money game. PM’s make a profession out of screwing subs out of money whether it’s contract or CO money doesn’t matter. They typically hold the keys, or whoever gives them their marching orders does rather.\n\nThe supers are for the most part left with whatever they get. So the higher ups tell the supers “get so and so on the damn job!!” But what they don’t mention is so and so is still owed CO money from a job from 18 months ago, you know, shit like that. They dump the dirty work on the supers. \n\nThis isn’t just my experience this is literally every guy I know who’s running work in one of the largest markets in the country. \n\nAnyway the point is that the new guys have an uphill battle right out of the gate. The biggest part of what the job of being a super has become first and foremost is directly managing the trades, as most of these subcontractors are sending unqualified people to the jobs who can’t read drawings and additionally a lot of them don’t really know what’s supposed to be their own trade. This is where the experience factor can be an issue, and problems arise. Then second to that they have to sort of bridge the gap between the office and the field all by themselves. \n\nAdd all of it together and it’s a ridiculous load to bear.",
      "Back when I was an intern at a top 3 enr company we had a field engineer there who was early 20s. The project was a series of concrete tilt up warehouses and he was supervising the pour. \n\nIt’s 3am and the first trucks roll in and the mix isn’t right. He shut that pour down until the salty old sub superintendent signed his name on that mix. It was like two hours of screaming and phone calls and I’m sure, at least in the subs side, the owner was roused out of bed. When the time came and the sub was screaming and spitting he was right there with him. \n\nIf you think the kid has it in him then he probably does. It’s about maturity, ownership and responsibility. Getting shit done is the name of the game.",

If he's good they'll keep trying to push him around, and if he's really good they won't last on his project.\n\nAt 39 years old I've never stepped on a job with a super that was younger.

One of the GCs texted stating that he wanted to connect us with his architect to get her to meet with us and do some detailed plans.

Cost for the drawings would be between $800-1500. \n\nMy SIL passed her GC exam and originally drew plans using the software her company has for this purpose (her company is too far away to work with us). She says the only thing that would need an engineer's sign off would be a double laminate beam we want installed. She also said, “what if you pay the money, don’t like the plans, and don’t go with that contractor?”\n\nMy question is - would these architectural plans be able to be used by any GC if we decided to go with a different contractor? i assume if our county requires them for permits that they are needed, but wasn't sure if another GC would accept them.

      "NC GC here...most counties require stamped plans. if there are structural changes (as you alluded to with the new beam), an engineer can look at your drawings and create specifications needed to your project. \n\nIf this is a large renovation, as you described, its best to have detailed drawings so there's no misunderstanding with your contractor. \n\nBut yes, have an architect or some other qualified person make plans for your project. someone who is independent from your contractor.",
      "  Okay, great! And these plans could then be used by whichever GC we end up selecting for the project, correct?",
      "Keep in mind that having approved plans doesn't mean each GC will be apples to apples when pricong.  If the plans are lacking details/coordination, you could be in for some big change orders once contract is executed. The city and/or county will not protect you from this.  A negotiated contract with a TRUSTED GC is your best bet...but the construction game be crazy.  Good luck.",
      "You’re paying for the structural engineer to sign off on your plans. Essentially. If you have someone competent to draw up a simplified plan on some graph paper and have someone take some drone shots of the land you should be good to get past the building department. I drew up some simple plans of if a renovation I was doing and got them passed pretty simple. I’m a contractor so I just robbed some details from some prints I was working with. Maybe not as easy for someone not in the industry."

If you are smart and good at what you do, you can move into a leadership position which pays more and is less labor intensive. \n\nFor reference, I am a PM and my field equal makes double what I do.

I'm a homeowner so apologies if I'm in the wrong place but it is kind of a construction related question.We DIY a lot of the upgrades in our house and we do our research and whatnot, but it seems that sometimes there's only so much you can glean from the internet. \n\nI ordered redwood for our deck railing (we installed Trex a couple years ago and are now doing a redwood/hog wire railing). Anyway, when I asked for the quote I stated \"premium quality\" 2x4s blah blah... Got quoted 17 something per board which I figured 'seems legit as the crap at home Depot is like 10-12$' so I said ok and paid.\nThe stuff I got was construction grade. So I'm wondering A) did I get ripped off? (See previous Home Depot comment). B) can I make it work (I called the guy and he said \"this is what my construction crews get and they throw a coat of something on it to make it look nice\"). 😑 C) if this IS the case, what's my best course of action? Sand it and stain it?   \nAny input here would be greatly appreciated. If there's another reddit that might be a better place to put this too I'm open to it. \nTHANKS!",

      "1. Look at all sides of the board. One is usually better than the other and with railing, one side is much more important than the other. See if you can hide some of the imperfections. \n\n2. Premium quality is generally a construction grade material in regard to lumber. You should be looking for grades like “A and better” and or “STK” be prepared for a higher price, sit down even so when you get the price of the higher quality stuff and start to fall over, your butt will keep you safe.  Afterwards, you’ll start looking at that beautiful pile of redwood you got there and think about making it work. \n\n3. Fuck Home Depot \n\n\n4. I guarantee you if you find a way to use the imperfections in that wood it will stand out and be admired far more than if you spend the big bucks on “perfect” looking wood. Embrace the nature of the board and your railing will be gorgeous.",

      "I would lean on whoever you bought it from to make it right. There are a bunch of different grades of red wood. I wouldn’t be paying $5 more per board for construction grade stuff. At least at Home Depot you can hand pick your boards. I would be hauling that back to the supplier to get the right stuff .

      "“Premium quality” isn’t a lumber grade so it’s hard to say you got ripped off. The quote they supplied must have stated the actual grade of lumber they were quoting.

Only calibrate with single mode but that's what you've got so your good.\n\nIt will tell you if the splice fails too, the actual splicing is dummy proof. Really the only thing you've got to learn is again, the stripping, cleaving, cleaning, and moving the un jacketed splice around without breaking it. Do make sure to leave anything open as little as possible, dust is the enemy. \n\nOh and the actual lasers in fiber are invisible, so once you get to certification/testing, make sure everything is off before using an inspection scope.

      "As a foreman, you have a lot of different cards you can play.  A good foreman knows when to play which card with which person.\n\nYour most common card is going to be \"because I said so\".  You've been in the business for a lot of years and you know things these other guys don't.  That's why you were made foreman when they weren't.  Most interactions you will fail because you get into a negotiation with people trying to justify your answer.  You don't have to justify yourself.  This is the way we are going to do it and we are going to do it this way because I said so, end of conversation.\n\nBut don't become overly reliant on that one card.  You have a lot of other cards and there are good times to play those as well.\n\nYou will have some guys who genuinely want to learn and better themselves.  For those guys the reason they keep asking why is not because they're challenging you but because they are genuinely curious why you want something done that way.  These guys will benefit from your taking the time to explain things and will enjoy your anecdotes of how one methodology saved or hurt you in the past.  But here's the thing with those guys, they might offer better solutions than you've never thought of before.  And sometimes being a good foreman means listening to them and changing your own behaviors when they do have good ideas.  Also, it's perfectly acceptable to respond to their questions of why with \"I don't know.  I was taught to do it this way and never questioned it.\" There is no shame in saying \"I don't know.\"\n\nYou also have the \"why did you do it that way\" card.  If someone is repeatedly doing something differently than you asked him to do it, stop and ask him why he keeps doing it that way and then actually listen to his answer.  There may be a legitimate reason why he keeps \"disobeying\" you.  Maybe no one ever actually taught him how to use a tube bender.  Maybe he gets lightheaded around 11am and really needs a snack.  Maybe something you assumed was true wasn't.  If you take the time to figure out why someone keeps doing something that you don't like, sometimes a simple solution will present itself (i.e. the reason they never clean up at the end of the day is because there's no garbage can on that floor).\n\nThe card that you never want to play is the terminal solution.  This is usually presented as a threat or an ultimatum.  Whenever you take this approach, you are backing yourself into a trap that you can't escape from.  This thing is going to happen again and since you made the threat, you have to follow through with it.  \"If I catch you on your phone one more time, then I'm going to fire you.\" Well, what happens when dude is on his phone and you try to fire him and your decision is overruled by the superintendent?  Or what if this time it was a legitimate emergency?  If you can't make good on your threats, then all you're doing is walking around the job site blowing smoke and people won't respect you.\n\nOne good rule of thumb that will serve you well 90% of the time is asking yourself, \"if this were my son doing this on a project, how would I want the foreman to treat him?\"",

Every time I screw up and have to do something twice, it reinforces the importance of doing it right the first time. Tell them even drug-addled maniac Hunter S.

First house we wired had missing jumpers.  I found out at hot check a few weeks later.  After that I would walk all the circuits he pulled and checked to make sure there were wires for everything.  Literally counted wires in boxes and if something seemed off I would ask.  He never missed another jumper which tells me he did it intentionally.  I didn't scream or even call him out on it.  Just double checked his work.  \n\nDon't do their work for them.  Make them do it until it's done correctly.  For a while I was doing QC for a residential company.  If there was a wire with nicked Romex I would cut the wire and tell them to replace it.  (I would cut it so they didn't have the option to tape it).

      "ima foreman been one for about 5 yrs and I’mthe same age as you are. I use to struggle with the same stuff especially with the guys i came up with before i was foreman. What helped me is i just sent off to other crews or whatever the guys that didnt know how to draw a line between me being their friend and me being the boss. I explained to the ones that stuck around that we both have jobs to do and as long as we’re hitting our dates and doing our jobs, we wont have problems. I also try not to nitpick because we dont work on an assembly line although sometimes i wish we did. Treat every guy as an individual while maintaining a standard. Set yourself up for success by placing guys where their strengths lie and always always make it clear to your boss who you want to work with and who you don’t prior to the job starting. Also find yourself a good pusher, lead, strawboss whatever you guys call it to deal with the employees while you deal with pushing the job along and making sure you’re prepared for whats to come. It also, IMO, makes it easier to explain and be on the same page with one person as opposed to a crew. Lastly make sure your boss has a backbone because i don’t tolerate tardiness, no call/ no shows, and being a slacker. I run them off.",

Remember you are not there to make friends and any signs of favouritism would not go un-noticed. Productivity has dropped over the years, and I agree a large portion of the younger team members do not approach work with any enthusiasm or need to get things done, not all, but for sure a large percentage.

They know they are my favorites and everyone knows *why* they are favorites. \n\nI also try to give non monetary perks when I can. Everything done and done right the first time? Go sneak off and have a smoke. Take an extra 5 for lunch. Bring in a snack at the end of the week and let the guys know it's because such and such was done well. I may not be able to hand out bonuses, but money isn't the *only* motivation. As long as the rewards don't become demands which can be tricky.

      "I've been a foreman for just over 10 years now. \n\nJust a few things that I wish I knew when I started out.\n\n\n\n1 - Do NOT be afraid to ask questions. Any question. Just because you are a leader doesn't mean you know everything. Everybody is learning something new every day, myself included.\n\n\n2 - If possible get your pouches/apron or whatever on and work with the guys. I know my guys appreciate watching me sweat it out with them. It shows you care about the job, and the crew by helping out.\n\n\n3 - Play nice with the other trades. Communicate with everyone, and even ask what they got going on. We are all on the same team trying to complete the job, we don't need to be assholes to each other just so that company can save a couple man days by burying the other trade with random shit.\n\n\n4 - Sequencing is your number 1 goal. For the job to go well for everyone, sequencing is essential. Some trades will take longer to do the work than others, and this is where it will be a tough balance of man power, and attempting to have the job flow smoothly. (You will almost never have enough man power by the way)\n\n\n5 - Money is everything. Everything is about money. Everything. You can use this to your advantage with extras/changes/even out of sequence work. Can also use this to give the good guys overtime if they want, and leave joe shmoe at home Saturday. When he asks just tell him that, that overtime is reserved for the A team. (That's only worked on like 2 guys to motivate them by the way.)\n\n\n6 - have zero emotions. The best and most pleasant people I've worked with use little to zero emotion. It's fine to have small banter, but any anger or frustration or stress do not show. It doesn't help anyone, and emotions just make things worse. That's probably not healthy at all, but it's worked out good for me.\n\n\n\nI can't emphasize the sequence part enough. \n\nMaybe some of this helps? Idk. At the end of it you gotta get experience, foreman is a weird manager/worker/project manager position",

Every mistake made is an opportunity to shoe them the correct method and for them to be accountable for their work, and hence proud of it.",

      "Being a leader is pretty straightforward, but it’s hard.\n\nMaybe the most important thing that you need to be is resolute — every person on your team has to understand that if push comes to shove, then what you say goes. Period. Don’t be a d-ck about it, but don’t give in. \n\nWhy? It’s absolutely _not_ just some kind of alpha male posturing. (Although it definitely can be.) Your confidence in your own choices is the backstop for all _their_ confidence in _their_ choices. It’s like the foundation of a house — your demeanor sets the tone of the entire collective exercise. \n\nThe next most important thing is humility — being willing to switch on a dime to a better idea, just because it’s better. Why? Again…not just to be more approachable (although that’s a big part of it), but to give _them_ confidence in _your_ confidence. They need to know that you’re not going to buckle under a little resistance, but they _also_ need to know you’re not going to confidently drive them off a cliff. The only thing worse than a leader with _no_ confidence is a leader with _too much_ confidence. \n\nOne of the best ways I’ve found to strike that balance is to have an ironclad rule on all my teams: “My way…or better.” That means that I’m usually going to share a very clear idea of how we _could_ do something — an approach I’m confident will meet the requirements, be efficient, etc. The very clear expectation after that is that the next time we talk about it, its either going to be done as I described, or you’re coming back to me with what you feel is a _better_ approach. If I agree, then we absolutely do it your way. If I hear you out, but say I’d like you to stick with my approach…then I’m just being polite. ;) \n\nEither way, though, you’re definitely _not_ going off and doing something different without telling me first.

Give them a task and allow them to complete it. At that point, it becomes a correctional exercise, and you are able to inform them how you would like the process done. Just know this part will be slow going, and there may be some feathers ruffled and some angers and temper flare. However, this is going to be a learning experience for both you and your men.

This method means that you have less discipline on the job because nobody respects you. But you can get drinks after work with them. \n\nThe second is where you are a bit more withdrawn from them. This has you asking them about their work. Rather than doing their job, you ask them if they think what they've done is acceptable. Make them think. With this method, you won't be as popular with them, but work will be done to higher standards, and as they come on board, they will gravitate towards you and your standards. \n\nMost people eventually gravitate towards the second. From there you can increase your standards, and times. The first eventually becomes a race towards the bottom, as everyone starts sliding and you can't catch all of it.",

    "Content": "Hi all. I’ve been doing a lot of contemplating about a potential upcoming job change and am hoping to hear some different perspectives.\n\nContext: I currently work with a large GC (top 10) in a Sr Cost Analyst role. I’ve been here for 2.5 years, home-based to large federal hospital project. I sit in the job office 4 days a week, spending day 5 typically remote or at our corporate HQ nearby. My company is pretty solid, no serious gripes other than hit or miss leadership and slightly low pay for the industry, but I’ve been applying around mainly because: 1. I feel detached from the work despite being so close / adjacent to it  & 2. I don’t see my company developing / investing in departments like mine with the same urgency as the operations / engineering’s teams. Being around the engineers as they problem solve issues in the field, negotiate change orders, even simply walking the site - gives me energy and excites me. Before joining the GC I worked for a mortgage bank in a credit analyst role for 2 years, I studied Econ and Political Science.\n\nMy dilemma: I’ve developed 4 solid years of (for lack of a better word)… financial experience and have opportunities to continue on the path I’m on and become a manager in the next year, or jump ship entirely back to a banking / commercial real estate position that would pay significantly more almost right away. Ive cone away from most of these CRE / banking interviews ‘excited,’ but mainly stressed about next steps. \n\nI recently interviewed with Turner about joining their team as a Project Engineer and came away with a genuine excitement different from any I’ve felt with other conversations. \n\nMy concern is that I’d be starting from square 1 (technically level 2/8 from E - Project Officer) and would be missing out on reaping the benefits of this 4 year specialized cost experience I’ve built up. I’m also concerned that I’d be burning bridges with the GC I’m currently at and would have to restart on all the relationship making / reputation building - kind of exhausting work that seems necessary in this field. I very briefly discussed the idea of becoming a PE with my current GC, but like I mentioned above, they don’t seem to give people in my role the same attention / urgency, even high performers.\n\nIf you were in my shoes what would you do? The three options I see right now are:\n\n- Jump ship on construction for a major pay raise in banking / CRE\n- Leave my current GC and start fresh with Turner\n- Stay where I am and discuss a move to a field role\n\nThanks in advance!

      "So, it's not a simple process to become a PE. You needa3 years of college at an ABET accredited college. Specifically within an engineering program. You need to sit for and pass the EIT exam. Then you need to work as an engineer under PEs who are willing to sign off on your experience in order to sit for the PE exam. You're looking at like 7 years minimum to becoming a PE. \n\n\nAnd FWIW I was a project engineer without a PE license for a while working on large projects. It was only a requirement for PMs where I worked.\n\n\nAlso Turner fucking sucks.",

Turner is offering me a Project Engineer role with the opportunity to advance to a PM in 2-3 years of good work. Obviously I take that timeline with a grain of salt, but it’s an exciting prospect nonetheless.\n\nCurious why you say Turner sucks, can you expand at all?"

If you have breakfast, have like eggs, fruit and oatmeal or something similar. \n\nI recommend taking a couple “body armor” drinks. They have sugar free versions, you will want them after your day. (Unless you’re allergic to coconut). Drink lots of water the night before, you hydrate for the next day. I suggest getting one of those metal water bottle or jugs to keep with you. (I work in Florida so it’s a need down here)  \n\nStretch obviously, be prepared to be tired and a little sore your first week. Like anything you will adjust to it!\n\nEdit - learn to read a tape now, they will likely have you clean, but be prepared to learn to cut, or lift / help a Jman. It won’t make sense for the first couple months but after that it will just be another job. Hardest part is showing up!",
      "Mouth shut and ears open. Theres VERY little you can say to impress anyone onsite. Listen to what your foreman says and keep your eyes pealed. Do not be one of those guys that feels like he needs to brag. We know better. Do those things and you’ll be fine",
      "Nobody has mentioned it yet but your feet may hurt. Boots will break in and calluses develop. Your body will adapt given time but the first few days will be the roughest. So pace yourself.\n\n\nI had a pair of broken in boots but after a few months of not working I had a bad time on my first day back.",
      "You havnt mentioned your background. If its not something trade related or agricultural or \"hands on\" then bring and wear work related and rated gloves.\n\nAs mentioned above, you will develop foot blisters and callouses from wearing in the new boots. If they are decent boots - always buy decent boots, get some gel insoles. Or quicken the wearing in process by stuffing the granny out of them with balled up newspaper and  soaking them in water overnight. Remove the paper and replace with dry newspaper. It draws the moisture into the boot as opposed to natural drying where its evaporated. Helps with softening the leather etc.\n\nBut your hands will fare worse. Even from sweeping up. You will develop hard skin in all the places between your palm/finger joints. These get very dry and can crack and it's quite sore. So until you grow used to it, wear gloves, or use hand cream. Even just hydration by washing is enough.\n\nBe early. Not by much, say 10 mins. People, especially management, fucking hate having to wait around. Even if your not late. Boss arrives at 7.20, has to wait 10 mins for you, immediately he has the hump unless your a known trusted colleague. \n\nDo what you're asked to the best of your common sense. Ask questions if you need to. We prefer answering questions than fixing problems by a job done wrong.\n\nI'm a Groundworks Supervisor (foundations, road formation, deep drainage, bridges, motorways etc) and I have agency staff arrive in my \"office\" every Monday. Make sure you bring all your paperwork and a lunch. Be sober and prepared to do about 45 minutes of paperwork before you're allowed out on site.\n\nBe prepared for questions. Answer honestly, as was said above, people who brag are very quickly found out.\n\nThe people I keep arent always the most skilled. The highly skilled guys on agency are either mercenaries or guys just working for their next drink/score. I keep the genuine, hard working, honest guys. My trade can be easily taught. It just takes time to understand and be trusted to make the correct decisions.\n\nBest of luck.",

      "Cut off the top flat part of the gable truss to match the rake. And build up the bottom to catch under the flat. The truss will bear on the rake wall and be fine, just make sure no nail a gable backer up the wall to nail the truss in the whole distance",

      "That would appear to be a load bearing wall. Doesn’t look like you put a header in there. If these two observations are correct then expect the wall to settle over that door and make it impossible to open. You will be able to tell when it starts by the cracks showing up in the drywall. You could hang a framing square on the door trim and watch as it slowly moves out of square. Nice door though."

    "Content": "So I(34M) have been installing  residential windows for 10+ years and have worked for a lot of major vendors over the years(Pella, Renewal by Andersen, Powerhome Remodeling, Window Depot, Windows USA, and most recently Lowe's). About a month ago I started with a company that has been in business locally for over 40 years and have their own in-house installers as well as in-house manufacturing of their windows. They have a few others installers that have been installing for as long as I have, but only have installation experience though this company and installing their product. Within the first week they asked me questions about how my experience was working for other companies generally. But what stuck out as the most frequently asked questions were about the payscale. They were usually blown away by how much I said I got paid per window and how what they get paid is no where near that amount. After a brief probation period I got switched over to being paid by-production(piece-work) and asked for the company's pricesheet. I saw that their payout per single window is only $50 and once I saw that I voiced that it was far too low from what I'm used to as a 1099 employee. Saying that one of the lowest payouts per windows was Lowe's at only $110. The other installers also got copies of the pricesheet and have made their frustrations evident. Oh, this company splits all window money amongst installers evenly so $50 is actually $12.50 after being split hence the frustration. Our Project Manager(PM) is new to the window industry and has no frame-of-reference so he looks to me because I have experience with other vendors and their payouts. Even with my experince in the window market I don't feel like I myself have all that much knowledge when it comes to a fair, payout for a window installer in East Texas that has the truck, trailer, and tools provided. Along with any material that is needed to finish the job(trim, caulking, foam, etc.). Does anyone have a good grasp on what I could go to my PM with regarding a fair payout? This company, despite being in business for 40+ years, has only been paying by-production/piece work for under two years so the installers here need good information to make their case to the company. This company feels like its set in it's ways but open to new ideas(more money for installers) if there is hard data backing it up, otherwise they'll think its only an opinion.",

So no posts align with each other at the top.

We showed up, moved our material out of the way and came back in a week when everything had been cut free, posts leveled and plumbed and the beams welded back in place. We showed back up and had straight runs of beams that were level within a quarter inch at 40'. We were able to get started then.

It's framed like you have it here and they've lasted 50 years and probably would last 50 more. Using a header is definitly better but it won't destroy your opening not to have it unless you have a lot of weight right above it.\n\nIt's similar to how in the U.S. everyone likes to pretend screws will break with the slightest shear stress.  But a cheap deck screw conservativly only has a small amount less shear strength than a nail gun nail. Interior non-load bearing walls are fine to build with screws and this style of framing.",

Most apprentices I've had recently have been absolutely useless so it's nice to see someone taking pride in their trade. Oh and I wouldn't take too much notice of the comments from all the wannabe carpenter's from across the pond. Calling an architrave margin a reveal ? Just goes to show that our college's actually know how to teach. Keep up the good work",

Was this setup for paneling?\n\nYou don’t need a header for a non load bearing wall fir a door, but it’s nice to slap something up there to nail trim too. People around here are really moving to the big 1x6 headpieces for windows and doors and it ducks if a framer didn’t put anything above the door. \n\nAs for the door, a secret tip is to set your door, and see how much room it has to move once it’s closed. In most cases, it has quite a bit of rattle if another door nearby is shut hard. The fix fir this is taking the latch catch and bending the actual catch part with your hammer to make the wiggle room almost zero. \n\nAnyways, looks great, good to see stuff like this.",
      "  Honestly have no idea about the horizontal backing. I didn't do the framing part, but everywhere I've worked they've always wanted a header on a non load bearing wall as it means you can foam up between the frame and door lining",

Ain’t nothing wrong with doing it, and even better for a test. Is this common in the UK by the way?\n\nYour trim carpentry is also tits. Especially around the door. Yeah the outside corner on the baseboard could have been a bit better but I read you didn’t have other material, plus it’s tighter than half the shit I’ve seen - especially on tract homes.\n\nOne question though, since I’ve moved to Europe (and I see it on your inside corner too), I don’t see a mitre on the inside corners or on the runs for baseboard, why is that?

But you get an A- if you didnt rip on the instructor for not having a header LOL",

You're not paying attention to detail and you simply are not taking any Pride or craftsmanship in your work. You're just doing what's needed and that's it.\n\nNow to your dress your wibbly wobbly wood, there is actually nothing wrong with having a unified pattern of nails throughout the entire job with the occasional placement of nails where needed because of the wood being a natural product.

However, most hacks don't understand that, and I guess you don’t either. That kind of attitude carries throughout your entire work habit, which you develop over time in construction.\n\nFor your information, even the smallest piece of baseboard should be handled with the same level of workmanship and pride as the mahogany fireplace wrap and mantle.

      "  And cleans.  Made a huge difference when hand moving sheets and lumber up stories.  Not a perfect comparison, but that low to high transition repeated over and over is important to have good form for.",
      "    Exactly. Anything from the strongman competitions is good too -stone lifts, log presses, farmer carries",
      "      Yeah, the “shoulder to overhead” category is always very useful",
      "  I did good mornings for 2 years getting my lower back as strong as I could to preventing tweaking it while working.",
      "  Bench press would be useless? Have you never had to push on something at work?",
      "    Yep, and the limiting factor is never pecs. It’s abs and the friction your shoes generate against the ground. Maybe in the rare instance that you’re braced between two objects would stronger pecs be beneficial",
      "      Brother your pecs are barely a factor in bench. They’re basically a stabilizer like bicep and lats. It’s a shoulder and triceps dominant exercise.",
      "        I’d agree if you were describing the overhead press. But the bench very much uses strong pectoral contraction",
      "          I benched 365 at 181. Go post your thoughts on a powerlifting forum and you’ll find out why you’re wrong very quickly. Dudes with huge bench presses will have huge seated overhead presses. The standing version will only be hampered if they don’t have a strong core. ",
      "            Strong core is useful in construction. Seated is just awkward",
      "      I dunno man, I get into weird positions all the time where I wish my pushing capabilities were a bit better. I’m a climber so I’m pretty strong pulling but relatively weak pushing. I get what you’re saying too though, usually my feet are sliding away first 😂",
      "I worked with one big fella who was absolutely dead pulling wire. He said “these muscles are for show not for go”",
      "  I would've pissed myself laughing so hard. Sounds like a chill modest guy.",
      "    I did! We had to stop the wire pull cuz we were crying. It made it even better that we were with the old timer who was barely breaking a sweat.",
      "      It's always the old guys that can outwork anyone. When I was like 22 in my prime as an apprentice , I came across a few that would outwork me, and I bust my ass, lol.\n\nThey still do, but at least I'm not in my prime anymore.",
      "        When we were young we had to try and make up for inefficiency with more physicality or moving faster. Now with all the “reps” we know how to do things more efficiently with an economy of movement",
      "The more muscle you carry around the more weight you carry around. That’s extra wear and tear on my knees, ankles, etc. every time I climb a ladder or get up and down off my knees, and it takes more effort. I find staying lean and working on stretching and core strength is what works for best for me. I’m a big dude and I can pack on weight pretty quick lifting weights, but I just don’t see the sense in it now that I’m older.",
      "I’m the only one at work that goes to the gym regularly and I can pick up far heavier material by myself than others can.",
      "  Which lifts do you think have the best carryover?",
      "    Look up what powerlifting meets measure, those are the ones you’re looking for.",
      "    Anything strongman style lifting related, picking up weight from the ground such as sand bags or deadlifts, squats, any sort of press movement such as shoulder press.",
      "  This is it. Combination of the two is optimal health and strength wise.",
      "I find the shoulder workouts definitely help , but im usually mounting things overhead at weird angles and doing that all day for a week kills me",
      "Certainly helps prevent injury.",
      "Deadlifts and/or squats for overall body and core strength.\n\nSome kind of pressing shoulder exercise \n\nSome kind of row exercise for middle back and biceps \n\nSome kind of stretching leg exercise for flexibility and support muscles like lunges or Bulgarians \n\nSome kind of lower back exercise like back raises or good mornings\n\nCore/ab exercise for stability\n\nMaybe a trap exercise to make it more comfortable to carry things on your shoulders.\n\nAlways form over weight.\n\nHelps immensely at my very physical job and advanced age",
      "Strength is great, but endurance and recuperation time is king. I’ve known a lot of guys that could lift a heavier beam over their heads than I could, but I’ve met few who could grind all day, go home limping and stiff and show up at 7 am tomorrow 100% ready to go as consistently as I can. That will ensure your job more than anything. As a contractor I worked for used to say when we’d ask if we had more work, “keep showing up!” Edit: single most important thing is lift with your legs, keep your back straight!",
      "Flexibility and muscular endurance are probably more beneficial than being able to lift a car",
      "Yea in the fact that I’m sore and tired at work all day.hahaha",
      "Yes.  If you’re stronger you’ll have an easier time in construction",
      "Endurance is better than just power. You can ask for a second set of hands for power, but not the other.",
      "Deadlifts, squats, over head press, cardio, eating healthy. All you need",
      "I've had a few guys working for me, their whole life revolved around the gym. You look in their car, and it's full of protein powder and weight lifting magazines. All they want to talk about is how much they benched or what their workout routine is. Their entire wardrobe has something to do with weightlifting. Then you tell them to get on the other end of something heavy and help you lift, and they can't do it. \n\nI've worked with plenty of guys that worked out at the gym and were plenty strong, but the more that the gym was their entire identity, the more likely they were to not really be that strong.",
      "  I think looking at those clips with the body builders going against rock climbers can really illustrate the difference.\n\nI helped a buddy of mine for a weekend move about 30y³ of dirt that the tractor put too far back and after a few attempts we resorted to shoveling it by hand, that was a hard ass weekend. My buddy brought his labourer up to help too and this guy was a straight body builder but thought he could hold up landscaping/stone work plus get paid for a workout lol. Dude was wiped out in the first hour with me n my buddy plowing through the rest",
      "Not necessarily the lift/strength/weight part of it, but I notice a huge difference in endurance (cardio and muscular) and ESPECIALLY in general energy levels and soreness. \n\nLifting weights in the gym regularly makes the rest of your life easier, period. It’s the best thing you can do.",
      "An important lesson is that working hard is not the same as working out.  You can do hard labor for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and you will feel broken down over time.  If you add 30min of lifting to that you will feel stronger and stronger.  Military is classic for this, morning PT and daily training isn't enough, if you supplement with an hour of running and lifting on your own at the end of the day you realize that the PT and training become easy.",
      "I’ve been lifting about twenty years. I really enjoy deadlifts and farmer carry. I also work as a pipe layer and equipment operator.\n\nIt helps hugely. I can put a pipe over my shoulder that three coworkers struggle with, I can also move heavy shit in the weird spaces and configurations using muscle and leverage. I regularly adjust my manhole barrels with an iron bar, I can move a few tons around with the right positioning and leverage. \n\nI’m still not as good as the old bastard who trained me, this leathery little Newfoundlander who could adjust a 6 ton OGS one handed with a rock and a six foot iron bar while cursing and smoking a dart. Takes me about four times his effort to get shit done, skill counts for a lot.",
      "Yes but I think the biggest takeaway is how much more bulletproof you'll be. Performance and going heavy is one thing, but I think protecting yourself is far more important, and you do that by being strong.",
      "Overhead press, front and back squats, and deadlifts, have undoubtedly helped me lift safely at work."

      "  Be very careful with this. Any company which makes you a matching offer to stay has already started to look for your replacement.",
      "    Agreed. I never really intend to stay which is why I name an crazy high number, but it did work once in the past. I stayed another year and used the new title and higher salary as leverage to jump to another job.\n\nI don't feel bad, cost of living increases many times faster than raises. I do a good job while I'm there. I never promised to be an employee for life.",
      "      This is the way. Corporations don’t give a rats ass about you, if you die they start hiring. Take what you can, I would hesitate to show any company loyalty",
      "    That's not always true. It's one thing when an employee continually asks for raises, is denied, then eventually comes up with an offer for you to match. Then yes, they might be looking for your replacement.\n\nBut most employers are not constantly looking at their employees salaries looking for reasons to raise. If the employee never mentions a raise then the employer will assume they are content with what they have with small COL raises every year, out of sight out of mind. Then the employee suddenly initiates the raise conversation by saying they have another offer, the employer might match/raise because they actually want to keep them, not just because it's what they have to do to keep things going short term.",
      "  Line up a new position after saying you currently make 120k, then they'll offer 140k! Then say you need 160k to stay",
      "    Yes. Basically depending on what you think you can get away with. 😆",
      "  I would just ask for the raise and not necessarily tell them up front about the other job offer. If they say no… then that’s when you tell them about the other offer. Be ready to jump ship though. Emphasize how you know the trade and the people and you can help the company out.",

      "  Risky strategy, HR teaches employees to start looking for and training your replacement once you ask for a match to another offer. They don’t trust you now and corporations don’t give a fuck about you. However, small companies this may not apply but be careful.",

      "    They had the option to pay more and they chose not too. Unemployment is the consequences of their lack of action. The fact they think it is some slight against the company, and their willingness to fight their former employees every step of the way just shows their pettiness.",
      "      Unless you are in their finance or accounting , You don’t know if the company had an option to pay more.   if you understand anything about finances there are budgets to follow. \n\nAlso, you don’t know if the person requesting the raise is not performing at a particular pay scale so a raise would not be warranted.  by telling your employer that you have an offer from another company that is their queue that you have resigned, and therefore are not entitled to unemployment benefits.  \n\nNo employer is going to trust that you are vested in your position if you’ve been looking around and interviewing at other companies .  Of course, they will terminate your contract with cause and therefore not entitled to unemployment benefits.\n\nInstead of threatening your employer with another job offer, just go out and get another job offer quit playing games. This is your livelihood. .",
      "        Note that everything this user said is legally wrong and all of the advice contained within is arguably bad.\n\nYou have not \"resigned\" by mentioning to your employer that you have a competing offer for your labor.\n\nYou can not be terminated \"for cause\" and you will not be ineligible for unemployment benefits because you mentioned you have a competing offer for your labor.\n\nNever listen to random strangers online.",

      "  If they had an offer at $xx amount… got fired… why is unemployment even a debate? If they filed for unemployment it shows they lied to their employer telling them they had an offer that they obviously didn’t. If I was the employer I would most definitely fight the unemployment as well. Just proves the employee was dishonest by insinuating they were going to be leaving to take a higher offer unless they got a raise. I’d assume the employer won any time this happened. And rightfully so.",

      "      Agreed 100%. There seems to be a hate towards employers from the Reddit community, maybe because it’s full of Millenials who expect everything to be handed to them, even if they aren’t performing to expectations. And before I get it handed to me, I’m a Millenial, and also a small business owner. So I’m in the thick of it every day. I can tell from day 1 those who have been jumping ship up the ladder and can’t pull the weight that comes with pay scales that they are demanding, and those who want to excel. It’s amazing what our generation will do to employers to try and make more money and get paid for “unemployment.”",
      "    Lmao come on. This is the same thing companies do when they give quotes. They basically contrive all kinds of ways to increase costs and justify them.",
      "      Then they should justify their value rather than lie about having an offer elsewhere. As many of the comments said, go actually get an offer and use it as leverage. If it doesn’t get you a raise, take the offer.

      "The easiest way to get big pay bump is to get a new job offer \n\nIf you really want to stay with your employer you can use an offer of $120k as leverage but you got to be ready to walk and take the new offer too if they don’t match.\n\nIMO I would get a new job at the salary level your looking for instead of wasting your time staying at your current company, even if you get it matched to $120k",

You need to show me you’re going to make me that money back or you’re just a loss in my book. I don’t like losing money.

Also, are you sure you want to leave now when the company is being bought out and is presumably growing with the mother company, which could soon be an opportunity to take on a higher paying role?",
      "Hard work and perseverance is how you earn more money.   (Let’s see them downvotes kids!)",
      "Counter offers are almost universally NEVER good ideas. You've broken whatever 'bond' you've had with your leadership and the only reason they're usually offering more money is to cover their ass on whatever project you'd be leaving. If they wanted you and valued you, they'd pay you to begin with.\n\nIf you want more money, make moves and walk out the door. \n\nAnd whatever you do, do NOT ever try to leverage that counteroffer with your new company.

The contract is the minimum. That’s what they HAVE to pay you. They can, and do, pay people more all the time.",
      "Back when I was in the restaraunt business the best way to get a raise was:\n\nAsk for it. Get denied.\n\nContinue working for a week or two\n\nMention you'll prolly quit if you don't get a raise, get told still no raise\n\nEither put in two weeks or quit on the spot a few days later \n\nThen they give you a raise to keep you there or bring you back\n\n\nI'm assuming it's similar in this industry",

Screwdrivers that get fucked up turn into caulk tube stoppers/foil piercers. Anyone who has spent any time in construction has at least one or two sacrificial homemade tools.

You can though, and as you have noticed they come from the same spots. \n\n\nAn anecdotal analogy would be the repaired tendon in my thumb.  It took about 5 years for it to creak substantially less, still does and probably always will because things are slightly out of place and rubbing on each other.\n\n\nFrom a physics standpoint you need to massage your house.

So you might as well get as far ahead as you can when areas open up to you for trades that  don't require complete temperature/moisture control. \n\nSomething to consider, though, is that you may need those exterior walls complete to a certain level before you go higher with the steel in order to lock in the structure to its engineered strength for the building dead load.",

If you were lifting pre painted steel into place the manufacturer would refuse to warranty the product for numerous reasons such as the paint may get damaged, the manufacturer has no real idea how or for how long the steel is stored or transported, or alot of steel is imported from countries where the correct application of the product can't be assured (not to mention potential damage from transportation). All this would mean that paint would have to be fully checked and any remedial work carried out.

Most structural steel will come to site with a form of factory applied protective coating anyway which would need to be ground off if any welding was necessary. So this isn't the main reason that intumescent coatings aren't applied before being shipped.",
      "          Ah yeah makes sense and seems pretty obvious now. Thanks dude!",
      "            Yes. Lots of things can cause the fireproofing to crack. You definitely want to do it after you pour the concrete slab on deck above because the deflection would cause so much flaking that you'd need to clean it off and redo the entire thing. Then, they need to come back and patch anywhere they damage the fireproofing for hangers or drilled penetrations added later. And, of course, people knocking into it on lifts or with building materials. \n\nIt takes a long time to do properly and you should wear a respirator and full body suit if you're anywhere near while being applied. Perfectly safe when dry, just don't go eating or snorting it.\n\nNext time you're in a steel structure building, you usually can see it in the fire escape stairwells around where the stairs tie into the structure. It can be painted over to match the masonry, or it may be still in the gray it usually comes in, but either way it's the really chunky looking stuff.",

Just look at pearl habor.\n\nSo stupid lol\n\nThese types of comments just aggravate the shit out of me as a 30y deep construcrion worker\n\nThere were no \"demolition charges\" bro, the buildings pancake collapsed because the fires severely weakened the structural steel\n\n\"Jet Fuel cant melt steel beams\" is also an incredibly ignorant belief, like staggeringly stupid and exposes the person saying it as a braindead uninquisitive person that doesnt even have a surface level knowledge of what theyre saying because a 30 second search for information online will instantly  debunk that whole thing\n\nJet Fuel is essentially Kerosene, it can burn as hot as 3800°F Steel Melts at 2500-3000°F....But heres the thing, you dont need to melt structural steel to have a building collapse you just need to heat it, it starts losing significant strength at around 550°, at a 1000° its lost 60% of its room temperature strength and 50% of its stiffness...Guess what? You can get there with a wood fire, or, say for example, multiple entire floors of a massive building and all its contents of paper, cubicles, computers, furniture  and everything else thats in there.\n\nThere is also not all that much \"excess\" strength in a building, its not economical and its impractical. The planes took out a major portion of the structural strength of those buildings, matter of fact its a fucking *miracle* that they didnt collapse immediately-----real loud shoutout to the engineers that designed those buildings, chefs kiss-----, so right from the rip they were seriously and severely compromised  structurally, there went all of the \"excess\" that was alotted for those structures, add a massive fire that weakens the remaining steel by 40, 50 60+% and its a wrap. Theres a reason why the second tower hit was the first to fall, it was hit much lower than the first and had WAY more weight on top of it, and given the construcrion of the buildings once one floor collapsed all that weight slammed down on the floor underneath it and collapsed it immediately, thats just what happens, you can prove it with an  experiment yourself with popsicle sticks and hot glue like any entry level engineering student in highschool\n\nThat this stupid fucking conspiracy wont die just makes me angry, and it makes me extra angry when i see this shit on any  construction sub\n\n~end rant\n\nE- we arent even going to adress Pearl Harbor, there isnt enough time in my day to deal with that *other* stupid ass thing you said lol",

I’m not from the area, but I am in construction.  We don’t have a lot of buildings in Vancouver that require fireproofing because they are almost exclusively built using only reinforced concrete.  A lot more buildings in the US are built with steel.   A lot of people have said that they are hung to prevent things from falling, but if that was the case then why aren’t the tarps hung on the 30 floors or so above where they are shown in the photos.

      "Containment Hording ?",
      "So back in the World Trade Center days (up until 2009) when Goldman Sachs was built in nyc.  When they built steel buildings and pour concrete after it’s all good.  In the winter when it’s too cold to pour and cure concrete they have to set many pots of coke on fire (byproduct of coal).  To retain heat they need to keep it going for a few days after.  I’m not sure of the schedule but After they pour concrete they spray Monokote which the floor needs to be warm and contained as well.  It could have been also for exterior work such as paint or waterproofing as well, something for wind.  Back then nyc all you needed was a wood barrier after they built the floor, it wasn’t  for debris flying off.  \n\nSource: I am a nyc union electrician that was part of deck jobs, not on the original twin towers though",
      "  As someone who doesn’t live near a city, how do they pour concrete up there? I don’t think our boom pumps reach 🤣",
      "    2 ways, on concrete deck jobs where it’s all wood forms at first and the deck (top floor) is exposed the cranes can bring huge buckets of concrete up where they would empty out on the floor.  On steel decks they can keep building on top of the steel and q- decking (floor of the steel deck), they pour concrete later on, in that case they have a huge hopper with a pump and a rigid pipe running up to the floor, the concrete trucks empty into hopper and it is a continuous flow.  Every pump you feel the vibrations, at the end of the day they have to pump what they call a softball thru it to clean the pipe out.  They leave the pipe in and add to the riser for the next floor",
      "      I was going to guess something like the fixed pipe you described, but the crane makes sense too. That’s a lot of mass to push to that sort of height through a pump, boom pumps have to be cleaned a similar way",
      "        >That’s a lot of mass to push to that sort of height through a pump, boom pumps have to be cleaned a similar way\n\nYup, super high pressure pumps, i think regular concrete needs 1.5psi of pressure per foot",

      "What's great about these photos is it shows exactly why the towers fell the way they did. These towers used central columns and the exterior wall to hold the weight of the building up. This gives them previously unparalleled amount of open floor space in those offices. Look at the tower to the right and realize that's hundreds of feet worth of open air inside a building that was impossible to build without these unique features.\n\nSo when the structure collapsed all that air was forced out through a pancaking effect. It looked just like a demolition. Other buildings of that height never had as much open space. If you bought a floor in a similar sized building you had to contend with columns and structural support within your spaces. If you look at the older buildings like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler building there are very few spaces of open air within it. If you were near the middle you would not be able to see windows in 3 directions the way you could in the Twin Towers if you stood at an elevator. On the Twin Towers the top floor had as much open space as any other due to the weight supported in the middle and the exterior",

I do like this job, but what I do is very niche in the lighting industry (construction). Because of this I feel like I am pigeon holing myself in this job.\n\nI have voiced to my company that I want to pivot to project management. While I do think they are hearing me, the need for them in my company is pretty limited and if I were to EVER get the position, it seems it is years away.\n\nI took it upon myself to approach an electrical distributor in the area, that my company has a working relationship with about a project management position, and they were very receptive. We met a couple of times and based on the last meeting I think they are preparing to make me an offer.\n\nA little background about myself - I was an Electrician for about 8/9 years and then moved into this field tech role about 2 years ago. I know a little about project management through being in the field but I would be lying if I were to say I knew everything about it. My current job has me doing a project management lite sort of role for certain jobs. \n\nThe reason this distributor is so interested in me, is for the fact that I have such a technical background, they were excited I could \"talk the talk, and walk the walk\". With me joining I would also be freeing up a senior member of their sales team to no longer have to go into the field. And now I would be filling that role of going into the field 1 ish times a week to have meetings and or troubleshoot an item in the field. They are confident I can learn the role easily.\n\nI was wondering if anyone could shed a little bit more light on my situation. I am happy to answer questions if there isn't enough information given.\n\n  \nI guess bottom line what I'm asking is what will the day to day look like and will it be a hard transition. ",

      "As a senior project / program manager for almost 20 years.  I am a little confused about this role they want you in.  \n\nMany companies give the title \"Project Manager,\" but it's more of a catch-all title.\n\nProject managers lead project teams, handle risks, remove barriers, good communicators, are good with financials, and can see around corners.  You're a leader.  You are directly responsible for the success of each project. \n\nMost companies like project managers with a PMP certification. I would also suggest Agile Certification too.  Lean / Six Sigma is a bonus depending if you want to go into manufacturing.",

    "Content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI’d like to reach out to those who own fire protection installation companies to get your opinions and possibly some advice.\n\nI’ve been working for a company that specializes solely in fire safety installations in warehouses for three years. The company I work for doesn’t win contracts directly but takes subcontracts from larger companies.\n\nFor the past two years, I’ve been working as a foreman. Under my supervision, we fully assemble fire safety systems in warehouses over 300,000 square feet (about 8 systems) within 12 weeks. We handle everything, including office areas, except for the pump room. We have all the necessary tools and work vehicles, while our employers provide materials, lifts, and forklifts.\n\nI’m planning to start my own business. I already have a registered company and I’m in the process of obtaining NICET Level 1 certification. My team currently consists of one master technician and myself, and I can find three more workers (or more) if needed.\n\nMy plan is to secure a subcontract from a larger company for fire safety installations up to the pump room, similar to what my current employer does.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n\t1.\tIs it possible to secure such a subcontract at my current stage, as I’m just starting out?\n\t2.\tWhat documents and licenses are required to enter into such a subcontract?\n\t3.\tWhat are the typical terms for such agreements?\n\t4.\tIf I sell my hours and the hours of my workers, how much do companies usually pay on a subcontract? From what I understand, it’s more profitable for companies to hire subcontractors and pay twice as much compared to their own employees, while avoiding the need to keep them on payroll.\n\t5.\tHow is payment typically handled: hourly per worker based on project duration (12 weeks) and the number of workers, or as a fixed fee for the entire job?\n\t6.\tWould your company be interested in services like this?\n\t7.\tWould you consider working with a startup company like mine?\n\nI would appreciate any honest advice and responses. I hope this helps me get started successfully!",

      "I would think you would be better off to tear down the house and start over or move. Neither the crawlspace that needs to be dug down nor the 5.5' \"basement\" likely have footings and foundation low enough to accommodate your 9' basement. That means you'll have to redo the whole foundation of the home while the house is on top of it. Why not go out or up if you want more space?",
      "  Not always possible to build new, up, or out. My house is on a zero lot line on two sides and is already below living space threshold that city allows for new builds. If house ever got torn down, there would be no legal way of rebuilding. Half of the footprint is crawlspace so I've considered creating more basement. \n\n\nWith a really small conveyor and dump trailer, its pretty reasonable for a confident and patient contractor to get it excavated. House does not need to be jacked up all at once, blocks can be installed piecemeal under foundation as it goes, just one or two jacks but ideally zero snow load as you work.  My state, and many others, do not require soil tests for low slope existing buildings. John Carroll has some YouTube videos of how he does it.",
      "    Happy cake day! Not saying it's impossible, just that it's very difficult.",
      "Are you finishing the basement for more usable storage, living space, rec area, etc? \n\nJuice might not be worth the squeeze. Better off with an addition IMO. You certainly can do what you are thinking, but you better be the goddamn best in your area because you are playing with serious consequences if done improperly.",
      "  The goal was to turn my smaller 2 bedroom home to a split level. \nThe markets so ungodly ridiculous right now we're not in a great position to move. \nSo I'm running on a hypothetical. If I lowered the basement could add another bathroom put living room and kitchen down there and 1 more bedroom. I could turn this place into a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom. Can't say I'd get a full return on it. But it would make living here more comfortable as we're growing our family until we are ready to move.",

      "20k lol\n\nYoure looking at many multiples of that\n\nYou cant just dig out a basement, the entire foundation needs to be underpinned, there are engineering soil tests that need to be done, and it all has to be done by hand, the digging has to be done by hand, all the dirt removal has to be done by hand, the foundation work has to be done by hand\n\nIts a big, very expensive project which is why its pretty rare to see anyone doing it",

      "20k more or less??? Lol. He thinks maybe less than 20k..",
      "  No that was asking for ballpark within 20k of how much it should be.",
      "Even if you were just finishing the basement and it was already the proper height, I'd say $100k. I would not want to fuck with what you're describing.",
      "Unless your house is locked by major historical restrictions, it would likely cost the same if not more to knock the house down and rebuild it. Digging out a basement like that is incredibly difficult, and risky, and is only done by specialized crews who are willing to do the engineering and take on the liability.\n\nI’d be shocked if you could find someone do it for under $200k, my guess is it would be closer to $200-300k. A quick search and you will quickly find people spending $100-200k to dig down a basement 1-2 foot you are talking digging out 4-7 foot down.\n\n$20,000 would not even get you a 9 foot basement If you just had a flat piece of land. Depending on your area that will run you between $40,000 and $100,000. You might be able to cut $5-10k if you are using block and super cheap labor but that’s a big maybe as poured wall cost has come down a lot over the years.\n\nBut waterproofing and a slab will likely run you another $10-20k. Realistically if you are not factoring for a multiple six figure budget you are never going to make it past planning. And all of that is assuming you don’t have to relocate any utilities, and that the structure above it is in good enough shape to be lifted.",

      "  Reading the comments I found it fascinating that when companies gift certain mass produce cheap items to their staff - these seem to illicit negative reactions.\n\nI delved a little deeper into the psychology of this as I too am kinda with OP (well OP said funny but i saw his true meaning behind that word) - I highlighted some parts\n\n**Expectations v Reality**\n\nWealthy companies often cultivate a brand image that conveys luxury, quality, and exclusivity. When consumers engage with such brands, they typically expect gifts or promotional items to reflect this image. A small plastic bottle may seem **trivial or low-quality** compared to what one might anticipate from a high-end brand. This discrepancy between expectation and reality can lead to feelings of being undervalued or disrespected.\n\n**Symbolism of Value**\n\nGifts are often perceived as symbols of appreciation and value. When a company gives away something that appears cheap or insignificant, it can be interpreted as an indication that **the recipient is not valued highly** by the company. This perception can evoke feelings of insult because it suggests that the company does not regard its customers or clients with the respect they deserve.\n\n**Environmental Considerations**\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing awareness regarding environmental issues related to plastic waste. A small plastic bottle may be viewed as environmentally irresponsible, especially when offered by a company that has the resources to provide more sustainable alternatives. This can further exacerbate feelings of insult, as it reflects poorly on the company’s values and commitment to social responsibility.\n\n**Socioeconomic Implications**\n\nThe act of giving a small plastic bottle can also carry socioeconomic implications. It may reinforce stereotypes about wealth disparity and privilege, suggesting that those who are affluent do not understand or care about the needs and preferences of their workers. This disconnect can lead to resentment and feelings of being patronized.\n\n**Psychological Impact of Gift-Giving**\n\nGift-giving is deeply rooted in social psychology; it serves as a means of building relationships and expressing goodwill. When gifts fail to meet expectations—especially from entities perceived as wealthy—it can create cognitive dissonance for recipients who feel they should be receiving something more meaningful or substantial.\n\nSo it's normal to feel insulted when receiving a small plastic bottle from a rich company - it stems from mismatched expectations based on brand image, perceptions of value, environmental considerations, socioeconomic implications, and psychological impacts associated with gift-giving practices. These factors collectively contribute to an emotional response that perceives such gifts as inadequate or disrespectful.",

    "Content": "I am a civil (water) engineer in training considering learning AutoCAD Civil 3D so that I can produce quality grading and drainage plans for ponds, channels, stream restoration projects, and some land development. \n\nWhat do you find useful about a grading and drainage plan designed by a civil engineer? How helpful are they? How closely do you follow them? Are the plans just general guidelines required by law that you often ignore and end up figuring out the grading/drainage on your own? \n\nI am trying to get more experience in the field but Reddit will have to do for now..   \nThanks!",

      "I can only speak from the commercial side having never worked in residential although Apartments and Sr living and such would be the same as commercial. \n\nLiterally the Civil plans as a whole, not just grading, are the foundation to the foundation of a project. If the civils, including the geotech report, is not followed, pretty much to the letter, your in for major problems. As for grading, it is not something you \"just wing it\" in the field. There are very strict laws on how drainage has to be handled to prevent you from just dumping your problems onto a neighbors property. Also cities will look very closely on how your draining the site, channels, to creeks (if allowed), detention ponds, underground storm systems etc.. Typically the smaller the town the more they will look at as they don't want their systems to get overwhelmed. This all must be followed. \n\nThat isn't to say that sometimes you can't VE the civil plans like any other trade. Had a job a few years back we saved $17k on the storm just relaying it it out and doing two connections vs 1 which cut out a bunch of pipe. \n\nAs for grading, you don't see VE being done on grading as much as usually it just is what it is. I did have a big grocery store development about 15 years ago we did a lot of work for and they were throwing a fit because the Civil engineer had done a big detention pond on the main corner. That was a huge loss in revenue by not being able to lease out the corner. I met with the city to explore ideas and come to find out they were just completing a new underground storm system with huge 6x6 box drains because of all the new development planed at this intersection. So, we literally flipped the site and drained it the opposite direction, took tons of fill, into a monster channel all the way around the site to the new drain system. It cost them a ton which is why I think the engineer didn't present it. The lease on the corner probably paid for it in a few years. \n\nSuggestion .... If you haven't, learn how to read a Geotech and what it all means! Understanding what's under that pretty grass is key to grading!",

      "The water is coming from the outside and that's where you need to stop it.  First, ensure the soil around that area (and around your entire house) is graded away from the foundation so water drains away.  Then make sure all gutters and downspouts are functioning and depositing water far from the house.  Then go outside the next time it's raining hard (grab an umbrella; if it's dark, grab a flashlight) and look for any water pooling next to the house; if you see some, work to make sure that water drains away from the house.  It's very possible that the above will work.  Good luck.",
      "  I appreciate your reply! I should have mentioned in the post, the ground outside of this wall has been graded away from the house, and a patio has been installed on it. There is no pooling around this area on the outside and there is a clean runoff. How water is getting to this point is beyond me. If possible in this situation I am looking for an interior fix.",
      "    Thanks.  Is there a gap between the patio and wall/foundation where water can soak into the ground?",
      "      From what I can tell there are no gaps. All gaps between the pavers and between the house and the pavers has been filled with a thick layer of polymeric sand. If I could update the post and add pictures I would. But it's a very clean patio job with minimal gaps and positive grade.\n\nI'll add too that a lot of the time when it rains, water will barely hit this close to the house since there is roof overhanging by 2-3 feet.\n\nMe theory is the ground is soaking up so much water, it spreads throughout the soil and then it makes its way to the cracks and very slowly leaks in. Just a theory though.",
      "        Yes, that sounds like a reasonable guess on how the water is getting in.",
      "          My first thought to fix this from the inside out was to have a foundation company inject it with epoxy. The foundation company I've dealt with in the past has done a great job with other cracks in the basement, dealing with them from the inside. They often have to drill and expose the crack more before they fill it, so they're hesitant to do it here.\n\nSo I was thinking, is there another material I can buy that has a thin nozzle I can fit in between the concrete and the beam and spray it like crazy. But I also don't want to go down that route if that is a stupid idea. That, or I contact a different foundation company that does injections.",
      "Could be coming from the sides of the concrete under the deck.   Try a hose out there during a dry spell.",
      "  Thank you! I will try that. I'm curious if it is water accumulating in the soil, which I suspect it is, I'm still looking for an interior fix that could fill this void.",
      "I understand the desire for an interior fix, but if you don't identify the source of the water and fix that, you may just make the problem worse. Sealing from the inside will trap the water against the wood beam with no way to dry, leading to rot and potential failure of your beam. You say your new patio is sealed and sloped properly, but it could still be subsurface water movement in the patio base. From your cross posting, I understand you are in Winnipeg, where we have clay soil, and you likely have a crushed limestone patio base. If the patio base itself does not have proper subsurface drainage, the surrounding clay soil can trap water in it like a bathtub, and potentially backing it up as far as your foundation wall. That could potentially be solved by better drainage on the downslope side of the patio, or some kind of french drain system to carry the water away, but I am speculating without seeing the patio and grading situation.\n\nTL;DR: Find and fix the water at the source, it is the only proper solution.\n\nEdit: I also see that you have steel bracing from remedial foundation work in the past, which would typically include backfilling with clean stone for drainage down to your weeping tile/sump system. If water is penetrating there, that means the foundation work was either not properly waterproofed on the outside, or that your drainage rock against the foundation has been blocked (perhaps by your new patio base) and is not allowing the water to flow down to the sump system. In any case, you'll need to find and deal with the water on the outside.",
      "  I appreciate your response very much. It makes sense. Unfortunately our house also sits much lower than our neighbors, resulting in drainage issues and making it harder to get water away from the house. But we've done what we can.\n\nIf it helps, I have a created an imgur link which includes a couple pictures of the patio here: [https://imgur.com/a/foundation-beams-0ktGlSf](https://imgur.com/a/foundation-beams-0ktGlSf)",
      "    Ah yes, the classic Winnipeg yard with nowhere near enough slope for proper drainage. I would try to contact whoever did the remedial foundation work to get their opinion, or at least to explain what kind of waterproofing they did or didn't do below grade. Beyond that, I don't see a fix that doesn't involve digging up some of your patio to see the situation, and/or some general drainage improvements for the whole yard. If you opt for interior solutions, you will encourage rot and just delay the inevitable larger fix. Good Luck.",
      "      Ok, thank you for your opinion on this. I appreciate it very much. The water issue has been an issue since we moved in, the previous homeowner claiming it was fixed. Seems like a common issue in Winnipeg but it doesn't make it less stressful.\n\nSounds like if I at least leave the beam as it is, the water will have somewhere to move and it won't rot out. The house is a 1970s home so I suspect it's been leaking for a long time.\n\nI'll contact the foundation company to get their opinion on this.",

Tadelakt can be DIY, but man, it looks like wet dogshit unless you do it right and seal it correctly.\n\nMaking one of these, you'll want to use a water-repellant or similar self-sealing admix in the concrete, in addition to whatever topcoat you use. Water LOVES to find its way through poured concrete, and you don't want a leaky sink. That hydrophobic admix is going to prevent stains or dies from penetrating the mix, and it won't absorb correctly. You'll get a patchy, ugly look, assuming it absorbs at all.\n\nAll for experimentation, and if you do go ahead let us know how it goes, but everything about this sounds like you're in for a big waste of your money and time, plus a massive mess. I don't normally gate-keep DIY projects, but this is definitely one of those \"you should probably leave it to professionals\" ones.",

We only need that corrugated pattern that's on the side of those sinks.\n\n...that being said it sounds like a bitch to try and achieve what we've thought up.

      "      I was 98% sure that when I made this post, someone smarter than I would do the detective work to determine it was unlikely to be a stick welder.",
      "      Ironworker here. I can tell you with the highest degree of certainty that shops do not almost always use MIG. To get a WPS approved for mig can be a nightmare because only Spray Transfer is a pre-approved process per AWS. It can be problematic proving beyond a reasonable doubt that your machine is set to spray transfer 100% of the time and nobody fiddles with the settings. Some shops that do utilize mig go to the extreme of locking up the controls to the machine so they can’t be fiddled with. For this reason FCAW is preferred process for in shop fabrication of structural steel. Duel shield is highly popular. Works well, gives good penetration, runs in all positions and is preapproved by AWS. Also very popular is self shielding wire in  Lincoln NR-305. This wire while having the draw back of being flat only has a higher deposition rate than any other wire. It’s easy to roll the piece and dump large amounts of metal with NR-305. When I see a fab shop that does run mig it’s potentially a sign of a poorly managed shop because it indicates that the shop hasn’t been set up for maximum efficiency and it’s also likely that codes aren’t being properly adhered to. Both are bad for business.",
      "        Structural steel welder, dual shield FCAW is the correct answer.",
      "          Our shop is slowly transferring from FCAW TO MCAW as someone in a white hat decided we should because reasons. We also have mig stations with locked controls and stick only stations for the odd customer that requires it. Yay Canada and dealing with customers from mexico to Alaska.",
      "            I've not used MCAW myself, I've heard some guys say that they don't like it and have problems with it. I can almost guarantee that your white hat saw the 10% or so greater deposition rate over FCAW and choose to switch to it to save money and get a big pat on the back. \n\nI would hate being in a place that has locked stations for only certain processes, modularity is king if you're working on different projects. Different story though if work is only pure production making the same parts made by bio robot welding machines. Only other reason I could think to lock out certain areas would be for specialty metal work, no carbon steel in the aluminum area, no carbon and stainless getting mixed in.",
      "              You are probably right about the white hat. He's full of brilliant ideas. Like switching to Chinese steel almost exclusively recently. Nevermind the absolute nightmare it can be to process or the amazing grease/oil poop layer it comes coated in that gums up every single thing it touches or that it's rarely straight or the hss seams don't always have fusion... I could go on.\n\nWe only have the MIG machines locked out. Every other machine on site is free to play with. Though that same white hat wants to lock them too so we can have a \"signature weld setting\" as he's convinced we can show off we made things that way. Our shop has a good size structural steel division but we also do machining and detailing for clients in many industries.",
      "                Mother fucker choose to switch to Chinese steel huh? I wonder if he told all of yalls customers that. If you guys do structural work outside of Canada and into the US especially if has anything to do with D.O.T. that's a big no go. Regardless of that ,what a absolute POS to pick inferior Communist pig steel.",
      "                  The man who buys Chinese steel is a treasonous bastard",
      "                  So apparently the customers are informed that their steel may come from a variety of global providers. If they want only NA they have to pay for it and it may have delays. All the Chinese/Taiwanese/Korean/Phillipino/Indian/etc is from mills that do have certified steel. So they get full millcerts with testing not to mention we send most of it for charp testing anyway. We do work outside of Canada and most American companies don't care if we use non NA steel. White hats favorite is dumped steel. Because it comes with a stamp saying product of Canada even if it was made in Taiwan and the millcerts need to be translated.",
      "        Where are you possibly working that somebody says they need to “lock up the controls”.  Who are the people that you need to prove something to “beyond a reasonable doubt” ?  I rip on our inspectors all the time for being paranoid, but this would have me rolling.",
      "          Merican welding society, every company that’s looking to have something fabricated that matters will only consider fab shops with certs",
      "          View the comments above it’s a common issue. When you start welding on structural steel AWS codes and the inspection process associated with them is a big deal. The problem with mig is when it’s properly set to spray transfer you get a good weld with good penetration. When it’s set to short circuit and you are welding on a half inch thick beam the whole weld could look good but have literally no penetration and just pop off under stress. So now you have a situation where you have a machine in the shop that is capable of making two different types of welds that both look acceptable to the naked eye, except one pops off under stress and one is actually good. From an inspection perspective you aren’t gonna sign off on any of those welds unless you personally witnessed the weld being welded at an acceptable setting or if the machine is lock into a setting that’s acceptable and tamper proof. Furthermore concerning structural steel, the purchaser of the steel usually hires a 3rd party inspector to verify the steel is acceptable before being sent out so you most definitely have something to prove to someone. Hope this explanation clears things up for you.",

He approached me and told me not to dig higher than my waist. \n\nSo I don't know why they didn't go to them immediately. That hole definitely takes more than 1-2 hours of digging. The DNR didn't need to be there to tell them that, that's a lifeguard job.",
      "      Yeah, but is that a section of beach with a lifeguard? I haven't been to a ton of beaches, but I've been to beaches without a lifeguard. So the DNR would be more like a Park Ranger, covering a much larger zone, and filling in where there isn't constant monitoring.\n\nIt might be a Western US thing, but I'm more used to having my recreation areas only lightly supervised, so I can picture a scenario where they don't have a lifeguard right there at all times.",

If admin tells you to just deal with it let the teacher's union know and they will go ape shit. At minimum wear masks.",

He's a little younger than me, but I've had significantly more exposure to construction holistically.\n\nIt's the #1 killer of every CM grad in my mind. They come out full of piss and vinegar, sorta-kinda know the paperwork process, double down on trying to learn it and other \"management\" techniques, and then get flustered when they don't get promoted over peers who didn't have the same education pipeline but had field exposure/experience.\n\nTo be a good PM, you don't have to know how to shoot lines or build cabinets, but you need to know how lines get shot and cabinets get built.",

It would save you from having to replace as much siding. It's going to take 3-4 coats of stain to get an even finish because it's so dry. Really soak the bottom edges multiple times so it gets sucked up into end grain the wood. It will help slow the rotting caused by rainwater splashing up on it and being pulled up into the wood. Also know that you will need to redo it every few years. Once it dries for a few days, get some color matched caulk and caulk all the windows, doors, and any other openings.

The only prescription that works is keep particulate out of your lungs in the first place, as much as possible. I wear a mask even when I sweep up at the end of the day, and every time I’m making dust that is known to be dangerous. Basically any kind of cement or masonry dust contains silica. In my younger days I didn’t wear a mask enough when making saw dust because I thought “it’s just wood dust, harmless!” Sawdust also contain silica, so it’s not harmless. Also, it’s never good to be inhaling ANY fine particulate. I mean, we’re all getting a bunch anyways, pollution, wild fire smoke, tire and brake particles when driving on the freeway, etc… But working in construction you’re getting way more than your fair share, the best thing to do it mask up when making any significant dust, and start from day one in your career, or if not day one, start today. \n\nI wish I had better PPE role models when I first started my career.

It was parked on the other side of the fence, but the checkpoint and gate was five buildings over. So I just had to watch helplessly, from 20’ away, as they scratched my roof up and shit in my box. I found the culprit.

Lots of crazy shit though, like why some inmates had single cells and a white 8x11 piece of paper with a Black X on it in their window. Or playing \"nuts and butts\" with the COs.

The guard looked at the slip then looked at me.  I hid my right hand with my left hand and pointed at the foreman.  Next thing we knew there were about 5 guards around the truck with guns ordering us out of the truck and demanding explanations.  The boss was not amused, and I was barred from working in there.

They were generally happy to see me and had lots of questions about employment opportunities upon release. I talked to them with respect like they were any other person and answered as many questions as I could. I found it a very unique experience and would definitely work prisons again. \n\nKeep your head on a swivel and always know where the CO's are.

The frame must be installed right because the screen glide is outside. The weather stripping on the door edge faces the outside in pic five like it should.

The contractor who installed said both sides of the track have weep holes and that some plastic pieces came with the door and that they didn’t know what they were for. They think the pieces are for those holes and are coming back to check it out. I’m not there in person to verify myself right now. ",

You can stick a screw driver in the hole and there’s a screw there to raise and lower each side of the door to square it with the frame.

      "It's understandable that you are concerned about your health and the situation with the mold in your home. While quick fixes like spraying mold remover might seem appealing, they often do not address the root of the problem. Mold remediation should be thorough and professional, especially since you've experienced health issues related to mold exposure.  \n  \nGiven your concerns, it's essential to ensure that any remediation is conducted by trained professionals who can properly assess the extent of the mold contamination and conduct effective removal. This process may include identifying hidden mold, especially in areas like behind your dishwasher, and addressing moisture sources to prevent future growth.  \n  \nI highly recommend reaching out to licensed mold mitigation experts who can provide a comprehensive evaluation and remediation plan. They can also conduct air quality tests to assess any ongoing issues and ensure your living environment is safe. For your peace of mind and health, take action to ensure the work is handled correctly from the start.  \n  \nIf you’re looking for resources or professionals in your area, we can help connect you with trusted contacts who specialize in mold mitigation. Visit us at \\[www.citywidemoldmitigation.com\\](http://www.citywidemoldmitigation.com) for more information and to take the next steps towards a healthier home. Your health is a priority, and you deserve a proper resolution to this issue.",

    "Content": "Anyone in here in the construction field and know about electricity? Earlier this morning I was digging in the ground with an excavator with rubber tracks.\nThere was a marking with electric in the ground nearby but checked blueprints and they showed nothing was there. Long story short I ended up hitting the electric that was there. It was ran in conduit with 3 or 4 little black wires and 1 ground wire. Heard a pop and all the wires pop out as soon as I scooped the dirt out. I'm pretty positive the pop was the conduit snapping and I never saw any arching or smoking or anything but I ended up getting outta the machine a minute or 2 later on the assess the damage and get help. My question or worry is if it's possible to get shocked and not notice it? I never initially felt nothing or had really any symptoms all day besides worrying. If anyone has any insight I'd appreciate it. Thank ",

There is a very good chance that you will have parts break during disassembly, will not be able to get replacement parts due to the age and style changes, and will never get all the cube pieces back with they’re original mate. Perhaps the safest thing if the owner won’t agree to carpet squares is to remove the cubicles in the direction of the carpet and only remove enough for a few runs of carpet. BTW you also have to have an electrician available to disconnect. Nothing looks the same when it is disconnected. Best of luck.",

Along with this new promotion, I was moved to a salary of $100,000 a year (Plus my company vehicle, phone, etc.) Beings this was a new division, I had a diverse range of responsibilities that included finding work (Sales), bidding the work (Estimating), and managing that work to completion. When I took the position, the division had around $300,000 worth of work on the books and was averaging 15% profit on that work. I worked hard, and managed to add about another million over that year to finish around $1,250,000 for the year with a profit rate around 25%. I then received a $10,000 a year raise to be at $110,000. The second year I was able to finish around 2 million in work, but upped the profit to around 35%. Following this year, I asked for another raise of $10,000 and settled for $5,000 a year, and all insurance costs paid by the company. Which leads me to this 3rd year and my current situation. \n\n I am tracking to finish the year at around $3,000,000 and currently averaging 55% profit (No I’m not exaggerating, last month we had a YTD average of 59% on all completed work). I also have $4,350,000 worth of work on the books for the rest of this year and into next. I should also mention that all profit percentages I’ve mentioned are after Overhead and operating expenses are accounted for (Labor, Materials, company vehicles, etc.). \n\nTo summarize, this was the growth since I’ve taken over. \n\nYear 1- 300k ~ 1.25 mil - 5 employees\n15% ~ 25% Profit\nYear 2- 1.25 mil ~ 2 mil - 10 employees \n25% ~ 35% Profit\nYear 3- 2 mil ~ 3 mil - 13 employees\n35% ~ 55% Profit\n\nI want to ask for a significant raise or bonus structure of sorts, beings that I have taken this division from 300k and 25% profit to 3+ million and 55% profit with 4+ million still to come. I find the work, bid it, and manage the employees that complete it. I am extremely self sufficient and run this as if it’s my own company. Are there any PM’s/others out there that do similar work that can speak on what a reasonable salary or bonus structure would look like? I appreciate any insight/feedback those may give and appreciate your time! Sorry this was long and hopefully I articulated it in a way that’s understandable. ",

      "That's a tough question because there are still a bunch of factors.  What about the rest of the business?  Does your side support it?  Etc.  \n\nSo you are 115k a year now.\n\nIf I take what you said and you are truly making that much for the business I would easily give you a raise.  Probably go more bonus based.  You might try that approach instead of a salary increase.  Or say 125k year + bonuses.",
      "  Rest of the business (5 other divisions) does around 12-20 mil a year collectively and averages between 5-15% on any given year. They do a decent bit of revenue and generate good cash flow, but aren’t as profitable. They’re also on a down trend and have reduced in size recently. They did 20 million a year 2 years ago, are going to do 16-17 million this year, and only have 7 million on the books for next year and beyond. I’m tracking to do 4 million next year from my division alone. If I continue my growth trend I’ll continue growing a million a year and soon be responsible for 50+% of the companies entire revenue. My division also requires only 3 office staff. Myself, my APM and our accountant/contracts admin. The rest of the company has 3 estimators, 3 admins, 4 PM’s, 2 Ops managers, and 80 field employees. \n\nSorry that’s a lot of information. Just trying to shed light. Thank you very much for your feedback!",
      "    I'm trying to think on how to respond.  This is a tricky area because all owners are different and probably have different ideas.  I still think you asking for a raise is totally fine and normal.  I still think salary + bonus(big bonuses) is the route to go.  If you are bringing what you say you are then you should be seen as a very valuable employee and if you aren't getting compensated correctly I would worry about that person moving on and starting their own business.  That's just my thought.  My accountant has always emphasized to pay employee's like you very well. \n\n\n\n\\*I am a specialty contractor and doing 20mil in revenue.",
      "      Thank you for the feedback. I think they are going to set up some sort of bonus program for me, but it’s hard as they don’t do that for anyone else. But as our owner told me “No one else is doing what you’re doing”. So hopefully it’ll work out as I want to stay where I am, I just also think I’m worth more than I’m currently being paid. \n\nDo you mind me asking what industry you’re in?"

I understood that it never expired nationally but I heard that New York City is different and requires renewal in 5 years. However, when I check the NYC website, I only see a card needs to be refreshed when renewing your SST (or site safety training) card when you renew it after 5 years.  SST was never required for my position so I wanted to see if in New York City, I still have to renew my OSHA card. ",

My fast food possibilities are  limited so I usually hit a local Walmart deli and grab a grab and go salad. I only use about third of the dressing they provide. They give you a lot. They’re only around $3 and they’re plenty filling. Especially when it’s hot. And it beats paying $10 for a salad elsewhere.

      "What I’ve found to be best for me is making sure I’m getting enough protein and fiber by eating nutrient dense foods. Today I had a plain Greek yogurt (I buy the individual servings instead of the big container because I can’t eyeball a reasonable portion), with some seasonal fresh fruit and a Keto English muffin with 5 grams unsalted butter (kitchen scale is a great tool), and some sugar free preserves (if you can have a sugar free option, not everyone can). Lunch was a mixed greens salad with chicken breast (please season your chicken so it’s less boring), baked sweet potato with seasonings, and a very low cal dressing (watch the serving size). Sometimes I buy canned chunk low sodium chicken breast because I’m busy/lazy/tired/don’t want to cook/bad at portions control, because I’d rather have something that’s good enough than blow my meal plan. Ihave some high protein and fiber granola bars if I feel like I need a snack. I’m on my third 33 oz bottle of water. Meal prep for tonight is three bean chili (fiber) with ground turkey, peppers, and other seasonings. I’ll have leftovers from that for lunch tomorrow or another dinner. \n\nI guess my main takeaway is it needs to be something that works for you. I’m not on Keto because I love fruit, but I incorporated the Keto bread because of the higher protein and lower carbs. I don’t like intermittent fasting because I like to eat and I think about food too much if I skip meals. For me, focusing on meeting my protein and fiber goals while staying below my total calories is best. Making sure I plan ahead so healthy things are easily available means I’m more likely to follow through.",

Lots of minerals and micro nutrients, do it consistently and it will shift your microbiome to be healthier, lots of fiber, and slight calorie restriction will benefit you.\n\nIf you don’t bring a lunch, and your only options are fast food, then you’re better off just not eating, and eat a healthy dinner. \n\nI’ve solved a lot of my health problems with fasting, intermittent fasting, and eating a ton of vegetables. I’m probably gonna get roasted by our brethren who live on monster energy drinks and gas station hot dogs. I’m old enough that I really have to have a great diet or shit goes south quickly.",

A lot of times I buy those premade salad kits and split a big ham over a couple of days (sugar free ham).  All meat and veggies here dude, still got the six pack.  I am a little less strict at dinner.  Paperwork days I have more attention and focus if I don’t eat.  Like skipping breakfast and maybe lunch at 2-3.  Learning to fast takes time and practice but is an absolute game changer.  If you do heavy labor it can be hard but some people do it.  There is a fasting sub on Reddit.  I’m big on paleo personally and sometimes do Keto but it can be hard since my wife and kids won’t do it.  I will only drink Saturday’s.   Of course everything I say actually only happens like 80% of the time as sometimes of course we all slip up but it works.",
      "5 years ago I ditched fast food except for 2-3 times a month. Switched to making Thai stir fry in big batches on the weekends and taking it with me. Mostly chicken, vegetables and a little rice. The right Thai makes EVERY VEGETABLE taste great. I also stopped drinking sodas and switched to water.

It changed my whole outlook on life",
      "Dunno if it's okay for cholesterol, but beef jerky and unsalted nuts are great as snacks. They're high cal but stay in your stomach for hours unlike chocolate bars etc    \n\n\nWhen eating out - avoid sauces. I order sth like salmon or steak versus pasta; protein based and a little less processed. Don't eat rice when eating out, at home swap for Brian or red or black rice. Drink lots of water during the meal when eating out.  But anytime you eat out they add loads of butter and sugar and salt.  \n\n\n Are you consuming any liquid calories? Quitting alcohol and soda will make a huge difference. I struggle w cutting out soda but soda has messed up my blood work before",
      "I lost a few pounds and I did it by not going on a diet. In my mind if I said, I’m going on a diet it would make me crave things more because I couldn’t have them so when I did, I switch to strictly water that’s all I drink and if I wanted something like hamburger, then I would just eat about half of the burger cause it was, no big deal because I could have one whenever I wanted it and every day I started walking after work I would not just sit and watch TV anymore. I started doing yardwork and if I did want something out to eat during the day at work, I just walked to the place and get it but no sodas nothing but water to drink and it helped. I lost about 130 pounds, but everything is good and moderation but if I crave a piece, a little piece of pie just went and got a little piece of pie and then the rest. I could just leave it alone.",

Partly do this diet because it's affordable, partly do it because it's healthy, but fast food and take out is too costly.",

That way you can just grab it in the morning. \n\nGet some almonds or healthy snack foods, to keep you going throughout the day.\n\nIf time is really short I've grabbed those salad packs in the supermarket and the pre cooked grilled chicken strips, a thing of cherry tomatoes and a cucumber and used those for lunch. \n\nEat something healthy for dinner too, cut way back on carbs and sugar, they are what make us fat.",

If you have the means to heat up your stuff soups are good. I also cut up vegetables and dip them in peanut butter. Got a bad of pistachios I tear into as well. I avoid breads and keep my boozing to the weekends but will cut that in October. I drink one coffee in the morning and a gallon of water throughout the day.",
      "There are no fast foods that will work. It’s likely this habit is why your cholesterol is where it’s at. The mental trap of “needs to be Fast” is really just a lack of preparedness. If you’re bent on getting your food out, then call a decent restaurant 15-30 min in advance.\n\nA lot of people forget how many reasonably healthy prepped meals are at your local grocery store. It’s a lot more food for way less money and it’s not as fake and unhealthy. Walk through your local grocery stores and see which one has a lot of easy grab options. We have one that has pizza, sushi, sandwiches, pre made salads, soups, an entire Italian section and a fish center that will fry or steam anything with whatever sides you want. And it’s like $12. The whole crew can go to the same place and get what they want. Y’all be laughing when bringing a vegetable platter with dip to the worksite becomes the norm.  \n\nIt also gets you used to going to the grocery store, so you can begin to food prep on your own. \n\nSkipping lunch is super unhealthy. You’ll likely binge for the missing calories."

Either way, you want a material softer than the surrounding concrete, but non-flammable.  This would serve the purpose.\n\nYou could also fill it with polymeric sand, or ordinary sand.  The polymeric would be more resistant to sweeping and vacuum action, and not very likely to catch fire.  \n\nKinda spitballing some ideas here, but those should work and preserve your slab.  You could also use lime mortar, which is available online.",

They have some less than friendly stances towards unions so this is not an endorsement of the organization or its policies, just as a resource",

      "    Well if it’s to help family out just assume whatever you need to make in 1 months time because that’s the least amount of time it is going to take. It’s always cheaper if they buy materials but make sure if they do that, the materials are being delivered and you’re not spending all this time gathering them from different stores. Also make sure to put a thorough list together before hand and take his credit card to go buy everything you’ll ever need on that job, plus extra(you can always return unused items, it’s better to have more to take back than to not have enough and spend more time getting some). Just saying when I first started out I was spending as much time on trips to the store as I was actually doing the job, it really slows you down alot more than you’d think. I’d also say, $8500 for labor on that isn’t exactly a “deal”  while it may be cheaper than others in your area. That’s enough money for my brother to be pissed if it doesn’t look good so make sure if you’re giving a “deal” it’s known that you’re just helping them out, or bump that number up a little bit so you’re comfortable giving more time on the project to make sure it’s A+ quality. Remember family always wants a deal and a lifetime warranty, I promise you 10 years down the road something breaks it’s going to be on you lol, just how it is. I steer away from friends and family and when I do work for them it’s pretty much my regular pricing but I’ll try to pass on my savings with suppliers and what not. Sorry for the essay.",

Instead of everyone agreeing what could be done in the field you have to stop what you are doing and submit an RFI to the owner. The owner doesn't want to take responsibility or have the knowledge so they outsource the RFI to some SME who charges $300/hr. Then you have to wait another 30 days for the RFI to come back and have 5 people each spend 10 hours on a problem that could have been solved in 10 min in the field I'd we were allowed to use common sense. \n\n\nOn top of that the owner wants to not go over budget so they try to fuck the GC on every little thing so the GC turns it around and tries to fuck the owner on everything they can. You can't just \"work\" with the owner anymore and just do what needs to be done to get the job done and allow the GC to have the opportunity to make a profit.

I had to sit with him as my dentist cleaned up and reinforced what was left of his bridge teeth (posts installed), get that bridge reinstalled and get decay and old plaque removed.    \nSince then, we have gone together every six months for our tune-ups, and he's felt better about it every time.",

I won the lottery with my dentist, he is super good at slight of hand and keeping the scariest things out of your range of sight, and he used to be a tradie before he was a dentist. So when he gets a tradie in the chair, they will talk shop a bit first so the patient can feel more at ease. He also speaks plainly with the guys. \"Okay so your tooth is 40% rotted out, I can do x or x, what do you want to do about it for today, I can do either.\" He never just assumes the patient's wishes and steamrolls them with no regard. He also explains plainly everything.. what he's doing, what after care is and how to do it, what to look out for in the long term, and what consequences could be. The man is a saint and a great communicator. He's done so much to get good care to those who need it, including my guys. That and he lets my guys pick from the goodie box when everything is done lol!

However, I've also read studies on \"optimism bias,\" where people tend to underestimate costs, which often leads to budget overruns.\n\nFor those of you with experience in construction or project management, how do you typically calculate your contingency fund? Have you found that 10% is usually sufficient, or do you prefer to set aside a larger amount to cover unexpected expenses? I'd be grateful to hear any tips or insights from your experiences.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nEdit: The project is a new residential up down 4plex, around 3700sqft.

Plumber drainlayer, I’m fussy now with this stuff. \nIf you want it to last you have to grade the soil out till you got clay. \n\nShape the clay so that the clay has the slope you want it to be. Over time the gravel will conform to this and the water will run this way naturally. \n\nI like to put down a really good layer of Geotech cloth. \nThen 3inches of limestone. \nThen 3 inches of gap 70 crush concrete. \nThen 2-3 inches of gap 40. \n\nThen a layer of Geotech and then lay the pavers and then backfill with dirt\n\nThe pavers will drain well and won’t disappear into the mud in a few years. \n\nSounds like a lot of effort but it’s incredible what a small truck and digger can do in a day. \n\nAlso plate compact constantly. \n\nYou also have to allow for the water to get out that’s gonna run through all the base course.",

Thanks very much. \n\nI skimmed and saw that the bolt in the red circle of the second photo here was indeed installed wrong … significantly wrong, actually. \n\nMuch lower and clearly off-center than it should be. \n\nI’m guessing the contractor who did it saw it was off-center and figured it “didn’t actually matter”. 🤦🏻‍♂️",
      "    Yeah, the bolt is based off the glass hole location. So if the glass was fabricated wrong it would lead to the bolt being wrong. Unfortunately, the glass hole location is stuck because the glass is tempered. Once glass is tempered, that’s it in regards to making any major changes.",

      "I’ve installed a few of a similar type of sliding shower door packages. First step is checking the walls threshold for level, ideally all is very close to square and level. Then bar needs to be installed dead on level. If the threshold was out of level, installer may have tried to cheat bar to compensate, which would be a mistake as the bar needs to be dead on for proper door roll. If the walls out a little, can be fixed by adjusting the wheels. If the threshold is out of level by 1/4” or more, that may need to be addressed first.",

I’ll need to look at that when I get there. \n\nAnother comment or shared the instruction manual and the bolt in the red circle was installed WAY off-center, so it was definitely a contractor/installer error."

I currently have a bachelors degree in marketing with some corporate experience in sales and inbound calls but I’m realizing that I really hate those roles. I’d rather get some actual manual labor in as I find it more impactful and rewarding. I have some experience helping out my grandpa building a porch. Whether that was carrying wooden planks, measuring, sawing, leveling, or screwing the boards into place. I’ve also done things like sanding a lake-house dock and assembling a media console as well. I’d like to get an actual construction job but I have no idea how to get my foot in the door. Any advice?",

I carried all of his lumber the whole time I worked for him but he let me use drills and nail guns within the first month or two, and it was just me and him. Be honest about not having experience, but mention that you are eager to learn, will show up, work hard, and retain the info when trained. Second company I went to is an owner operated kitchen and bath remodeler, I saw a now hiring sign on one of their company trucks. Smaller companies won’t see you as a number like most big commercial gc’s. Also depends on where you want to go with your career, I.e do you want to be a union man who does the same task and work for a pension? Or do you want to start a painting service that only does rental properties? Etc. etc. a million niches. Keep that in mind when choosing who to work for. There’s a lot of shitty companies out there, but a lot of good ones too, don’t hesitate to keep looking if you show up on the first day and are working alongside drug addicts and criminals. Gotta stop myself from typing there or I’d be here all night. Good luck!",

The class is on platforms, and the goal is to explore platforms that have not been fully developed in certain industries (as opposed to Uber/Lyft, where there is a very robust platform ecosystem already). I thought the construction industry was really interesting, because after talking with a family friend, he tells me he has an issue with having leftover materials after builds, and is never sure what to do with it. I'd love to tap into a bigger community of construction workers/managers to see if anyone else has this problem, and what solutions you all have found for it.\n\n1. Do you ever have leftover (but unused) materials after projects? What do you do with them? If you store them, is storage space/cost an issue? Are you able to reuse it in future projects? Under what circumstances would you throw away materials that are still usable?\n\n2. If you try to find a buyer, how does that work? Do you use a platform already? Is there a network of people you generally sell to?\n\n3. On the other side of the equation, do you ever buy surplus material or equipment from people? How do you find people to buy from? Do you trust the quality of the materials?\n\n  \nIf anyone can help answer these questions, I can't tell you how much I'd appreciate it!",

      "Biggest problem with reusing materials in my experience is tracking it through its lifecycle (ordering, receiving, sending to site, sitting for some time not being used, gathering and returning back into storage) all while tracking quantities which could vary from 1 to the 10s of thousands, and often times material is custom and job specific. It doesn’t make financial sense because every project will account for the new materials needed to do that job. Any money you can receive on excess materials from a previous job would just be a rebate on the material itself.",

      "Looks like it telescopes, I could be wrong though. Tower cranes can dismantle themselves. Or use another crane.",
      "  Tower cranes have a jig they use to remove/add sections. It’s a pretty cool thing to see. Once the crane is removed the holes for the crane get filled one after the other up the tower. They carry on as if nothing was ever there with their layouts and rough ins. Unless you knew it was there previously you’d never be able to tell where a tower crane was.",
      "I'll preface that all setups are different, but this one is a pretty standard external climbing job.\n\nSince the crane is outside of the building (minus the leave out down to the base, they'll just climb it down to the point where a mobile crane can drive up and take the top / extra towers down.\n\nProcess is simple, climber slightly lifts the top of the crane, the tower is slid out onto the introduction beam, then the cylinder is retracted until the top of the crane is sitting on the next tower. Then the process repeats (a lot).\n\nIf the crane were inside, it gets a bit more complicated, but would most likely use a small derrick.",
      "The other comments have pretty much nailed it, but one part they missed, is when the crane ties (the support bars going from the crane into the building) get removed, sometimes rope access glaziers have to come and put in the panels.

    "Content": "My absolute favorite work gloves are the Carhartt C-Grip, but I want to try out a handful of similar alternatives. For work do a wide variety of maintenance and renovations for offices and restaurants, but I rarely do anything extremely heavy duty. What I love about the C-Grip gloves is the TPR coating because it vastly reduces vibration and improves grip even on materials like stainless steel and glass. Meanwhile, they are still dexterous enough to pick out a screw from a pile or fish out the correct key from my keychain. This often comes at the expense of the lifespan, of course, as rougher materials eventually shred away the coating, and contact with grease and solvents will accelerate it further. I have an endless supply nitrile dipped gloves and disposables that I’m able to extend the life of these to up to maybe a month, but I’m sure that there’s got to be some better alternatives out there I don’t know about yet.\n\nDo you have any suggestion for gloves similar to these?",

Lots of people that can't afford a bare bones 6 figure build never mind 7 8+. \n\nI also know plenty people with zip failures and other wrb sheathing products.

Installed with poor ethics and poor QC and it will fail just as quick as anything else. \n\nAir tight houses are incredible, their benefits are high. But the poor quality of labor and disinterest to build correctly and train well means air tight houses can also have many faults and issues. \n\nMarketing success doesn't equate to higher end products. I'd rather own a home with basic products that were installed to the highest level of quality than ultra premium products built to the basic levels of quality. Skills with a product matter more than the materials and most (yes most by a large margin) are too lazy ( yes lazy or cheap or whatever excuse they have) to invest in developing skills. \n\nZips a decent product, but not enough people that use it understand or read it's manual well. Pressure activated adhesives are good, over driven nails aren't that much of an issue but can be, the resin in the OSB is much higher and basically makes the product waterproof. The exterior resin based web that is built in, is also great. The tape when installed properly should never fail, but there are limitations. For example overlapped joints per the instructions require acetone to allow the tape to adhere to itself. Bet you almost everyone that just read that went \"what?!\" It's in the instructions. The tape when rolled up has a coating to prevent it from becoming a giant tire 😂. That coating is to be removed prior to overlapping with acetone. \n\nThere are also manufacturer products that are voided without a decoupling material between, so tyvek or felt or a million other products may still be required for the assembly to remain under warranty. \n\nBuy products, read extensively, apply correctly, and double check install and instructions when in doubt.

      "      Ooh, I have milling questions! What range of height can you do? Can you taper from one side to the other?\n\nHow do you determine where and how much to mill if you're giving adjusted surface grades. I'm a civil engineer and anything we can add to make the plans clearer would be appreciated.",
      "        there are three things we do. (and one extra but is cost prohibitive for most companies or towns.)\n\nWe have lidar sensors we can use. We can mill using slope grade. we can use end gates and reduce or increase lag time when adjusting depth.\n\nLidar sensors. It takes a reading from the front set, the back set and the endgates. (endgates are the pieces on the sides of the drum). It takes the average of the whole system and gives you a flat plane for the mill to use and adjust depth on the go. We used this system on i93 and we got the highest ridability score Mass DOT has ever seen at that point.\n\nif you want the road to have a 3% slope from the crown, we will mill using the gyroscope. Also using the endgates, it will determine what the slope it is currently and cut the difference.\n\nIn the city of Boston, there isn't enough room to use the sensors, and often the road is so sloppy that we just cut 2\" or so (whatever the company that hired us wants) and they fix it with mix. but the end gates are accurate enough for this type of work and again, we just adjust the lag or eyeball the road and adjust the depth of the cut to get a flat plane. Say for the first 30 feet, the street is flat and true, then for 10 feet there is a trench where your engate would fall in, we often cut from 40 to 90 feet per minute, so a 10 foot long dip of a half inch we can adjust the time it takes the mill to adjust for changes in depth. Or what we often do is just dial the machine manually for the change in depth.\n\nThe mills we use have drums that are 7'-8' wide. We do have a 12' wide drum but that is only ever used on the highway when they just want the top 1\" off.  we also have a couple 4' mills and trimmers which range from 18'\" to 24\" but they are used to remove asphalt and concrete from structures and trenches. or Keycuts for the paver to tie into.\n\nWe can use each machine to taper pretty much whatever you want at just about any depth. Personally I have used a trimmer to taper from 0 to 6\".  I've seen the mill make a ramp from 0 to 16\".\n\nWe worked at Logan Airport and have taken multiple 12\" passes to take out a total of 36\". 24 hours a day for nearly 2 weeks, straight. These machines were tired at the end of the work haha. The last pass we used GPS to determine what the final depth would be at any given point.",
      "          Thanks for the info! We do a lot of work in Boston and Cambridge too, but tend to defer to the local civil firms for site restoration or improvements. I have done a couple \"repairs\" where the pavement is settled and/or graded wrong so it just had no where to drain.\n\nThe biggest challenge we have sometimes is trying to mill the grades back to what we need rather than doing a full depth replacement so that we stay under stormwater management limits.",
      "            Yeah those sort of jobs are tough. Especially in Cambridge as it always seems like instead of doing the full Street we end up taking out a curb only pass of about 7 ft. Then they try to fix it with mix and then the the gas company or the electric company will come in and dig a trench right after it gets paved. \n\nThen you got Frost heaves and what not destroying the shim work. You end up having cracks and broken seams within 2 or 3 years. \n\nThe only real success that I've seen is when you actually reset all the storm drains to grade. Most of the time after paving, everything settles and the only thing that stays true are the storm drains and now they're a half inch above grade. \n\nI've worked at Cambridge a couple times so far and I got to tell you that the roads there are in a lot better condition than pretty much all of Boston lol.",

Likely has a void in his life where no one was ever proud of him. Constantly needs people to think he’s better than them. Struggles to make personal connections.\n\n3. Relationship trouble - A narcissistic attitude easily sniffed out by women. Relationships are short, shallow, and few and far between. Conveying an attitude of overconfidence hides the shame of never having love or personal connections.\n\nI can keep going but those are my big 3.

      "  I can’t really answer past tense because that was quite a long time ago. But I’ve spent a lot of time in Poland and and Warsaw specifically there are so many large projects underway. It’s pretty mind blowing. First time visiting the country I thought it would be that old style eastern block, brutalist architecture. \nWhat I found was a very clean safe and modern city, Nothing like I would have expected. I rode a bike almost everywhere, the infrastructure they put in place for it is amazing. There’s actually traffic lights midway through each block that tells you to speed up because there’s a green light ahead and you can cross the intersection or start slowing down because you’re going to hit a red light. I know it’s just a small thing, but it’s that makes it a really easy place to navigate. I stayed several times in centro Warsaw and enjoyed my time there immensely. Many new steel and glass skyscrapers, great restaurants, gyms, coffee, shops, etc. Since joining the EU The city and country has quite a few American companies with offices, located there now. it’s also relatively inexpensive compared to other large cities in Europe. I was also in Warsaw, February 20 22 and the way the country handled the war in Ukraine was amazing. They had literally an army of people wearing orange vests with clipboards helping all of the refugees that were crossing the border with nothing but maybe a baby or an elderly relative on the other and a garbage bag or suitcase with whatever they could grab before they left. They, help them with accommodations, items would need clothing, etc. It’s something I’ll never forget, the people of Warsaw really came together and accepted a monumental humanitarian challenge head on. \nAs for news getting out when it was a part of the Soviet union, as is the case in Russia now all information is tightly controlled by the state. I can tell you the people of Poland value their freedom and would fight tooth and nail before they would ever give it up."

      "Finally another landfill gas friend. People don’t understand that this industry is a multi-million dollar a year deal, most don’t even know this industry exists. It’s dangerous, literally everything can kill you or hurt you. Gas, liquid, waste, heavy equipment, work machinery, trench collapsing and it goes on. \n\nJudging by the age of waste and depth of trench they’re installing new lines. Next to excavator appears to be newly “drilled” gas collector, could be supporting gas/liquid conveyance lines. Or \nPossible a horizontal gas collector, essentially a french drain for gas/liquid extraction. \n\nShould ole boy be in the trench with no obvious PPE, no. Tench is fairly deep and not benched out properly for occupation. Missing a hard hat, 4-gas meter (probably), benching, fresh air blower amongst others. Waste/Trash is always considered an I unconsolidated Type C soil. Although it is extremely stable due to nature of waste placement, I’ve never “trusted” it beyond a 4’ trench without boxes. \n\nStay safe man.",
      "  This was a mini expansion of about 11,000 feet of pipe and 16 new wells. My man's did have his gas meter on. However, fellas in this industry tend to refer to a hardhat as \"nothing more than an open casket.\"",
      "    Big project man. Nothing shy of a good time!",
      "  What are the four gasses that are worrisome in this scenario?",
      "    Typically contractors have meters set up for; Methane, Carbon Monoxide, Hydrogen Sulfide and Oxygen. Methane due to its explosive nature in certain mixtures, we hear about flash fires continuously due to HDPE fusion equipment and/or power tools sparking. Carbon Monoxide, CO poisoning etc. Hydrogen Sulfide is a seriously deadly gas and I’ve worked in situations where there has been enough to un-alive me instantaneously without supplied air. Oxygen monitored due to oxygen depletion/enrichment, helps identify other gases not monitored due to ratio change in surrounding air. \n\nLandfills are unique working environments, done correctly it’s an interesting place. \n\n**Note zoom in on the workers head and pan up. There’s a puddle of black liquid, called leachate. That’s what we deal with water wise when trenching. It smells, highly corrosive to everything and just not friendly.",
      "      Awesome, ty!  Is there a saturation level of leachate that acts like a water table (can't dig any deeper without being in the soup)?  Most landfills are lined, correct?  Or is it just the ground filtering the leachate before it gets to the actual water table?",
      "        Yes/No typically we aren’t trenching deeper than 10’-15’, 20’ in some instances (usually 4-6’ for conveyance lines). You run into an upper layer of storm water run off saturation in those depths, much like the picture above. The total saturation typically occurs during vertical well drilling (ever see Caisson drill rigs or Pile-on rigs for example; SoilMEC/CZM), basically a 36” hole saw drilling straight down to XXX target depth. In many instances during drilling operations they’ll hit mushy soupy mess where the rig can’t progress or complete obstruction in the waste mass. Every landfill is different depending on climate zone, waste stream, waste age and gas collection infrastructure present so saying where total saturation is on every site is impossible without survey information. Fluid is removed via automatic pneumatic pump over time in the newly set 6” or 8” casing, which is set in stone and pipe is perforated (vertical French drain?). Remove fluid helps expose more perforated pipe within the waste mass and increases the effectiveness of the well allowing the waste to “breath”. Gas is collected via vacuum and taken to a blower station where it’s flared or sent to an energy developer for conversion to high quality CNG or diesel/electric generators. \n\nAll modern waste facilities are lined to protect the water table and surrounding aquifers from contamination/intrusion. The older legacy landfills may not have the HDPE liner systems of the modern landfill, but they’re still lined with a clay base layer (Compacted clay, if done properly is impermeable allegedly). Imagine a super heavy duty blue tarp with 4-5’ of compacted clay below it, 2-3’ of filtration stone above it and a system of straws to remove the fluid on the tarp. There are ground water monitoring/sampling probes installed around each landfill.",

We all find unique stuff everywhere or something that just catches our attention, more of the than not you loose track of it quick. Rubber ducks are usually a guarantee everywhere atleast once a year. \n\nOP probably agree’s, general public is full of a bunch of perverts.

You get yelled at because you have lights off at night, get yelled at for blocking up parking spots or closing intersections. I remember one time someone tried to walk under our crane while actively trying to set a 25” pole",
      "  The part about the people unfortunately doesn't surprise me one bit. I think of all the dumb shit guys on sites do and they're the ones that are supposed to know better and I can just imagine the things regular people can come up with.",
      "At least he's wearing his harness",
      "Surveyor not wanting to deal with people getting in the line of sight.",
      "What trade you think? Electrician?! Fucking animals",
      "Dumb!",
      "Truly a no safe for working conditions post",
      "I thought this was a video",
      "No job is worth your life.",
      "  I agree. This was in a highly visible, very busy grocery store parking lot while i was getting a burger at the adjacent drive through. I'd like to think that some city inspector or even the grocery store manager saw this and put a stop to it. \n\nI, on the other hand, had to get back to my jobsite, and wasn't in a position to intervene.",
      "    As a former PM, I would find the current PM on that site and call him an asshole to his face for letting that happen. \n\nThis shit it asinine and stupid at best, criminally negligent at worst",
      "      This was lighting maintenance in a busy parking lot of an open grocery store. So no PM just these madlads turned loose and left to their own devices. \n\nI'd hafta say that the service manager or whoever dispatched these guys should have known the height of the poles and capabilities of their equipment though. Bossman probably told them \"just get it FUKKIN done\"",
      "        You’re damn right the boss man knew the height and still sent them. That’s the problem. Don’t accept that. Safe working conditions or walk. This shit is why we need unions",
      "Nowadays I’d be more worried about someone messing with the machine while I’m working than my ability to balance on there. That would make this a no for me.",
      "  Well this being in a busy parking lot, there's always the chance that some distracted driver plows into the truck while you're up there by the skin of your ass. I think he had a groundman though, but still",
      "That's maybe 50ft tops. He has a harnesses on so he won't die if he falls... I've done similar but at 130ft",
      "  Have you seen what can happen to someone when they fall with a harness on? It’s not like landing in a bed of pillows that shit will still fuck you up you just won’t die, if the harness actually works in the first place. This is dumb as hell and so are you, risking your life and bragging about it for a trade wage.",
      "    We are basically prostitutes whoring our bodies out for $$$",
      "    Yes I'm dumb and take unessarry risks. ",
      "Even in harness for have like 4 hours before cardio problems from circulation problems. If you are alone.",
      "  Suspension trauma causes death in 15 to 40 minutes.",
      "Are you trying to get hate fucked? Lol. But honest question, is this standard in your line of work or is it just you?",
      "  No i saw this one day at work while getting lunch. Went back to the job and showed a bunch of people and they were blown away. \n\nWhen i do dumb shit i don't document it. That's amateur shit"

    "Title": "Questions about Company Handheld Radios (Canada)",
    "Content": "Hey everybody,\n\nI’ve been looking around the internet for a few hours now and have yet to find anything I can really understand regarding the purchase and use of radios for construction companies in Canada (Alberta specifically).\n\nThe company I work for is about to start a series of large jobs and because we take care of a variety of tasks (erecting large suspended slabs, placing concrete, guiding concrete trucks and heavy machinery, traffic control) we’ve been looking to invest in a couples sets of handheld radios for our larger crews. Because I have the most “experience” with radios (not much at all and mostly on the amateur civilian side), I’ve been put in charge of acquiring them.\n\nI’m just wondering what the licensing/training (if any) for radios would look like and what my options would be with regard to the types of radios and communications systems that are out there. Apologies for my long windedness, and I’d appreciate any helpful advice/recommendations. \n\nThanks!",

      "Not from Alberta, not from construction, but, if I may... have you considered rental?\n\nThey'll be able to help you get the right product, with the coverage you need. And furthermore, be scalable, which will be really a pain if you buy.\n\nHoping this helps.",
      "  Thanks 🙏 I will look into this.",
      "Licensing and training? You set the channel and press the button to talk....",
      "It really depends on the distance. If you're not that far away from each other. You can probably get away with using all the Shelf walkie talkies. We had so many people on our project that they didn't have enough company radios. So every crew bought their own handheld radios. And each craft had a channel. But if you're really any distance away you need to contact a company that deals with this. They'll send out a specialist with their radio and set them up to make sure they're programmed properly for application."
